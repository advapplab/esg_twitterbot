       " 'Rather, it was an attempt to explore controversial issues from varied perspectives — not to tell people “what to think,” as he put it, but “how to think,” or what he called a “blueprint for how to make decisions.”In July, Mr. Licht made a highly symbolic pilgrimage to Capitol Hill noteworthy for its inclusion of Republicans like the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, and Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas. ',\n",
       " 'Although he spent equal time with Democratic leaders like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Mr. Licht was irritated that his visit was billed as an “apology tour” and effort to coax Republicans back onto the network — part of CNN’s perceived move to the right.After long absences, several Republicans have since appeared on CNN, including Mr. McCarthy and Senator Rick Scott of Florida.Featuring hosts and guests with opposing points of view and playing up controversy has paid ratings dividends on cable in the past, notably on CNN’s own “Crossfire,” which came under criticism for evolving into to a verbal food fight criticized by the comedian Jon Stewart as “hurting America.”But Mr. Licht said he wasn’t interested in controversy for its own sake, but to offer a “rational conversation about polarizing issues.” ',\n",

       " 'By Eric Lipton, Michael Crowley and John IsmayWASHINGTON — The prospect of growing military threats from both China and Russia is driving bipartisan support for a surge in Pentagon spending, setting up another potential boom for weapons makers that is likely to extend beyond the war in Ukraine.Congress is on track in the coming week to give final approval to a national military budget for the current fiscal year that is expected to reach approximately $858 billion — or $45 billion above what President Biden had requested.If approved at this level, the Pentagon budget will have grown at 4.3 percent per year over the last two years — even after inflation — compared with an average of less than 1 percent a year in real dollars between 2015 and 2021, according to an analysis by Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments for The New York Times.Spending on procurement would rise sharply next year, including a 55 percent jump in Army funding to buy new missiles and a 47 percent jump for the Navy’s weapons purchases.On Friday, Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden’s national security adviser, put the buildup in strategic terms, saying the war in Ukraine had exposed shortfalls in the nation’s military industrial base that needed to be addressed to ensure the United States is “able to support Ukraine and to be able to deal with contingencies elsewhere in the world.”Lockheed Martin, the nation’s largest military contractor, had booked more than $950 million worth of its own missile military orders from the Pentagon in part to refill stockpiles being used in Ukraine. ',\n",
       " 'At the same time, contractors remain concerned about investing to meet growing demand for weapons that could dry up again when the war ends or politics shifts course.',\n",
       " '“The difficulty of starting a production line back up, that doesn’t come for free,” Tom Arseneault, president of BAE Systems, which is now considering restarting its M777 howitzer manufacturing line, which the company had been in the process of shutting down. ',\n",
       " '; Middletown, Iowa; and Kingsport, Tenn., where contractors work with the Army to manufacture the ammunition that Ukrainian artillery crews have burned through at an alarming rate. ',\n",
       " '(The money for these programs is expected to be included in a huge appropriations bill that appears to be on track to pass Congress and signed into law by Mr. Biden by the end of the week.)Spending could be even higher, as Congress is also considering a request for an extra $21.7 billion for the Pentagon, above the already expanded 2023 annual budget, to allocate more money to resupply materials used in Ukraine.In an indication of how government policy is shifting to rebuild industrial capacity for the military, Congress this year has moved to allow the Defense Department to more broadly make multiyear spending commitments for certain weapons systems and shipbuilding operations. ',\n",
       " 'That is a provision that industry lobbyists have long pushed for, arguing it gives companies certainty that investments they make to start production will see continued returns in future years.',\n",
       " '“We have to make a commitment with the industry,” said Senator Deb Fischer, Republican of Nebraska and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who supported the change. ',\n",
       " '“Nobody seems to want to make the tough choices. Even the Democrats now seem to be afraid to be seen as being soft on defense.”The biggest barrier for growth for major military contractors — the list includes Lockheed, Raytheon, Boeing, General Dynamics, BAE, Northrop Grumman and Huntington Ingalls Industries — is finding sufficient supplies of key components, such as microelectronics and missile warheads, as well as a steady supply of new employees to assemble all these items.',\n",
       " '“You cannot throw much more money at the seven shipbuilders that build U.S. warships in the United States of America right now,” Adm. Michael M. Gilday, the chief of naval operations, said this month during the Reagan National Defense Forum in California, referring to a $32.6 billion shipbuilding budget in the military authorization bill that is $4.7 billion more than the Pentagon requested. ',\n",
       " '“Their capacity is about at max. And Congress is helping us max them out.”Raytheon, which has 180,000 workers, has hired 27,000 new employees so far this year, its chief executive said in October. ',\n",
       " 'But even with that, it is still running into bottlenecks in terms of available parts and labor shortages that are slowing sales, its executives said.The sheer scale of the munitions and missiles sent to Ukraine illustrates just how much matériel a war can consume.That includes more than 104 million rounds of small-arms ammunition, at least one million rounds of 155-millimeter artillery shells, 46,000 anti-tank weapons, more than 1,600 Stinger antiaircraft missiles and 8,500 Javelin anti-armor missiles, according to a Pentagon tally.The resupply challenge is not just a matter of money. ',\n",
       " 'The vehicles have been much sought after by Ukraine, which has used them to devastating effect against the Russians.Traditionally, Lockheed has been able to build 60 of these trucks per year, but it is now shifting production to 24 hours a day and seven days a week in an effort to bring that annual total to 96 units. ',\n",
       " 'At Lockheed, for example, about 70 percent of sales come from the U.S. government, and most of the rest from other governments worldwide. ',\n",
       " 'In the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Switzerland and Germany have both moved in recent months to finalize orders for the F-35 fighter jets, collectively worth $16 billion. ',\n",
       " '“Nothing’s cheap, right?” said Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro  this month at the conference in California, as he ran through many new investments the Navy is making. ',\n",
       " 'The Russian soldier was named Dmitri Tsvigun. ',\n",
       " 'That brief account got Mr. Tsvigun added to a list of confirmed Russian war deaths maintained by a small, dedicated team of data journalists and volunteers, as the Kremlin has largely avoided updating the number publicly. ',\n",
       " 'Run by Mediazona, the independent Russian news outlet, with the BBC’s Russian service and about a dozen anonymous volunteers in Russia, the list pulls information from sources like newspaper articles, photographs on tombstones, fellow soldiers mourning their comrades and even tips from relatives who want their loved ones included in the tally.The list has surpassed 10,000 names, including more than 400 Russians drafted recently.',\n",
       " '“If they do not understand the cost from the pictures of devastated Ukrainian cities, then maybe the number of dead Russians will make them think about it.”The Russian government has tried to avoid just that by barely mentioning the death toll from the war it launched with the invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. ',\n",
       " 'The team of volunteer investigators in Russia then search social media posts for the names. ',\n",
       " 'They crosscheck names against a government website that lists people deceased throughout Russia but that does not specify military deaths.Seven out of 10 confirmations come from local news reports, the data journalists said, while the others are a mix. ',\n",
       " 'They include announcements from local officials or employers; individual posts on VKontakte, the Russian equivalent of Facebook; and sources like pictures of memorial plaques put up in dead soldiers’ former schools.Every two weeks, Mediazona crunches all the numbers to break down the toll on its website, including deaths by region, military unit and age.The results can vary drastically by region. ',\n",
       " 'Some prefer to work with estimates of the overall number killed rather than a slice of the total. ',\n",
       " 'Others stressed that the work had been especially helpful in identifying patterns.',\n",
       " '“The project is a useful snapshot of the breakdowns and wider patterns in Russian losses,” said Karolina Hird, a Russia analyst at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War. ',\n",
       " '“We know that Russian authorities are simply not presenting truthful reporting on losses.”One early pattern, for example, showed that about 20 percent of Russia’s war deaths were officers. ',\n",
       " '“It’s terrible.”',\n",
       " 'In 2018, CNN’s New York headquarters had to be evacuated after a bomb threat.CNN remained enviably profitable, earning over $1 billion a year for the past five years. ']"
