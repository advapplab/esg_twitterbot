0	Oceans absorb up to 3 billion metric tons  of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year, but given the rapid rise in global emissions, they cannot absorb it quickly enough. 
1	This is a problem because when carbon dioxide meets seawater, it produces a chemical reaction that causes the water’s pH levels to fall and its acidity to rise.This process depletes the ocean of carbonate — an important building block for sea life including calcifying plankton and algae, shellfish, sea urchins and corals. 
2	Now, due to the rapid increase in global carbon emissions, our oceans are acidifying 100 times  faster than at any other period over the past 55 million years.If projected forecasts come to pass, our oceans’ surface waters could become 150 times  more acidic than pre-industrialized levels. 
3	This would spell the end for numerous marine organisms, ecosystems and the livelihoods of the 3 billion people who depend on a thriving ocean.It is the commercial staple of coastal communities, providing livelihoods for fishers and fish sellers, as well as sight-seeing boats and scuba diving opportunities that draw tourisms from all over the world. 
4	Indeed, a thriving ocean is essential to the lives of millions .
5	And yet, so little was said of ocean acidification in the negotiation rooms of COP27. 
6	"Only just this year were the words ""water"" mentioned in the final declaration text  from the climate convention, and while a National Ocean Acidification Plan was promised by the U.S., it will not be finalized until COP28 and may take years to implement.Not addressing ocean acidification head-on at the UN climate conference in Sharm El-Sheikh was a missed opportunity for reducing emissions. "
7	The ocean is a natural carbon sink and the healthier it is, the more it can perform its role as a regulator of climate. 
8	Between 1992 and 2018, the world’s oceans absorbed 67 billion metric tons of CO2, almost double the total CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industrial processes in 2020 . 
9	Putting ocean health at the center of the climate agenda is therefore essential if we want to make progress on tackling the climate crisis.Although their place on the global agenda was initially unclear, oceans fared better at COP15 — the United Nations’ Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) . 
10	This summit provided an opportunity for global leaders to give ocean acidification and other marine issues the attention they have long been due.  
11	After many, many hours of negotiations, Target 8 in the agreed declaration specifically calls on countries to minimize the impacts of ocean acidification on biodiversity and to increase resilience through mitigation, adaptation and disaster risk reduction actions. 
12	Long-overlooked, Target 8’s adoption into the COP15 agreement shows world leaders are united in their recognition of ocean acidification as an important global issue that demands attention.Leadership from the Global North, such as the U.S.-led pledge to conserve, protect or restore at least 30 percent of the global ocean by 2030, is especially welcome when much of the Global South’s coastal economies are made vulnerable. 
13	Nigeria is sub-Saharan Africa’s top producer of fishing and farmed fish, producing up to to 1 million metric tons of fish a year and engaging 10 million of the population in the industry . 
14	If rising acidity leads to aquaculture failure, communities and local economies here will be left critically exposed. 
15	Even so, northern economies are not immune. 
16	In our recent data visualization , we highlighted the fact that ocean acidity decimated oyster aquaculture across the U.S. Pacific Northwest between 2005 and 2012, affecting 3,000 jobs and $110 million in revenue. 
17	Since then, collaboration between farmers, government and business to restore the waters has brought the industry back — but it is in no way saved yet. 
18	We are running out of time to avoid the worst impacts of ocean acidification and we need the global community to come together. 
19	Researchers from Sweden’s Stockholm Resilience Centre created the Planetary Boundaries Framework, which designates ocean acidification as one of nine planetary tipping points — a limit that, if transgressed, could threaten civilization and life as we know it. 
20	But we can turn back the tide on ocean acidification if we act now. 
21	The best way to avoid the most severe impacts is to rapidly and dramatically reduce carbon emissions. 
22	In tandem with this, there are mitigation schemes and solutions that can be adopted quickly and scaled regionally and globally. 
23	Nature-based solutions, such as blue carbon habitats or coastal ecosystems, extract and store carbon, thereby reducing the amount of carbon the oceans absorb and its resulting acidity. 
24	Additionally, seagrass and mangroves in coastal wetlands also draw carbon from the atmosphere before it reaches the water, sequestering it in their roots, branches and surrounding sediment. 
25	Similarly, marine-protected areas (MPAs) set aside by governments for long-term conservation can be redesigned to mitigate and/or adapt to the effects of ocean warming and acidification. 
26	The U.K., among other countries, is inserting climate smart decision-making into its MPA planning. 
27	We need to tackle this crisis from all angles — through research, conservation, innovative technology, collaborative partnerships and funding. 
28	Agreement on Target 8 is a welcome milestone, but if we are to avoid the worst impacts of ocean acidification, it is time to turn this agreement into action. 
29	Equally importantly preparations already underway for COP28 of climate convention to pick this topic and give to it its due prominence.
30	New Rule Would Strengthen Grid Resiliency, Cut Carbon Emissions, and Deliver up to $15 Billion in Savings to the Nation  The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) proposed new energy-efficiency standards for three categories of distribution transformers to improve the resiliency of America’s power grid, lower utility bills, and significantly reduce domestic carbon-dioxide (CO2) emissions. 
31	DOE’s proposal represents a strategic step to advance the diversification of transformer core technology, which will conserve energy and reduce costs. 
32	Almost all transformers produced under the new standard would feature amorphous steel cores, which are significantly more energy efficient than those made of traditional, grain-oriented electrical steel. 
33	If adopted within DOE’s proposed timeframe, the new rule will come into effect in 2027.   
34	“The Biden-Harris Administration continues to use every means available to reduce America’s carbon footprint while strengthening our security posture and lowering energy costs,” said  U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. 
35	“Efficient distribution transformers enhance the resilience of our nation’s energy grid and make it possible to deliver affordable electrical power to consumers in every corner of America. By modernizing their energy-conservation standards, we’re ensuring that this critical component of our electricity system operates as efficiently and inexpensively as possible.”   DOE estimates that the proposed standards, if finalized, would reduce U.S. CO2 emissions by 340 million metric tons over the next 30 years—an amount roughly equal to the annual emissions of 90 coal-fired power plants. 
36	DOE also expects the proposed rule to generate over 10 quads of energy savings and approximately $15 billion in savings to the nation from 30 years of shipments.  
37	The Administration is also working to address near-term supply chain challenges and strengthen domestic manufacturing of key components in the electric grid. 
38	In June, President Biden invoked the Defense Production Act to accelerate the domestic production of clean energy technologies, including distribution transformers and grid components. 
39	In October, DOE issued a Request for Information to gather additional public input to determine how to maximize the impact of these new authorities. 
40	The comment period closed on November 30th and DOE is carefully considering the information submitted. 
41	See related article: DOE Announces $8 Million to Integrate Solar Energy Production with Farming Additionally, as the supply of traditional, grain-oriented steel tightens, DOE is focused on diversifying domestic steel production where capacity can be expanded, such as in the production of amorphous steel used in advanced transformers. 
42	In support of these efforts, DOE is also finalizing the implementation guidance for the distribution transformer and extended product system rebate programs established by the Energy Act of 2020 and funded by President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. 
43	This rebate program encourages the replacement of energy-inefficient distribution transformers and extended product systems with more-efficient replacements.   
44	A distribution transformer is a device used to change the voltage of electrical power. 
45	A common sight on utility poles in neighborhoods throughout the country, these transformers lower the voltage of electrical power before distribution to the customer. 
46	Purchasers of distribution transformers are primarily electric utilities and commercial or industrial entities.   
47	Current efficiency standards apply to liquid-immersed, low-voltage dry-type, and medium-voltage dry-type distribution transformers. 
48	DOE’s proposed rule would amend the energy conservation standards for all three categories.   
49	On Thursday, February 16, 2023, DOE will host a public meeting to solicit feedback on the proposed rulemaking from stakeholders.   
50	DOE’s Appliance and Equipment Standards Program implements minimum energy conservation standards for more than 60 categories of appliances and equipment. 
51	As a result of these standards, American consumers saved $63 billion on their utility bills in 2015 alone. 
52	By 2030, cumulative operating cost savings from all standards in effect since 1987 will reach nearly $2 trillion. 
53	Products covered by standards represent about 90% of home energy use, 60% of commercial building use, and 30% of industrial energy use.
54	Iberdrola has signed a partnership with Bilbao, Biscay-based Woza Labs to protect its power lines from climate change. 
55	The startup will use its expertise to develop digital solutions, such as geographic information systems and satellite image analysis, which will enable Iberdrola’s network business to predict, plan and quantify climate risks that may cause damage to network assets.  
56	Woza Labs is the winner of the challenge launched in October by Iberdrola through its PERSEO startup programme. 
57	The Basque company will design a programme to determine how climate change and its derivatives – strong winds, torrential rains, Filomenas – may affect Iberdrola’s grids. 
58	This will allow the company chaired by Ignacio Galán to prioritise grid investments or reforms to mitigate these risks. 
59	The aim is to scale this type of solution to the geographies where the group operates. 
60	Distribution lines are one of the pillars of the electricity system worldwide, and even more so with the integration of renewable production, the drive for energy efficiency and the improvement of the quality of supply. 
61	Iberdrola, with 1.1 million power lines, aims to reduce faults in distribution networks in forest environments, most of which are due to falling trees and branches caused by weather phenomena caused by climate change.  
62	The distribution grid, due to its extension and the new environmental threats, requires investments to improve its resilience, so that it is prepared to face these threats. 
63	The grid business is crucial for Iberdrola, which announced at its Capital Markets & ESG Day held on 9 November that it will allocate 57% of the total €47 billion in investments planned between 2023 and 2025 to this area (around €27 billion).  
64	The improvement of distribution lines is the way to change the traditional way of supplying electricity unidirectionally – from the transmission grids to the consumption points – to one that acts as an intelligent and interactive platform. 
65	Thus, this infrastructure will be able to integrate more renewable generation, and provide greater capacity for new associated innovations, such as electric vehicles, self-consumption or the electrification of heat, among others.See related article: Iberdrola Obtains Favorable Environmental Impact Statement for Onshore Wind Farm Project in Spain The challenge has been launched within the framework of BiOK!, the meeting place offered by BEAZ (an entity of the Department of Economic Promotion of the Provincial Council of Bizkaia) for the generation of new business opportunities, in collaboration with Iberdrola’s new smart grid innovation centre, the Global Smart Grids Innovation Hub. 
66	Iberdrola has transmission and distribution power lines in the United States, Brazil, the United Kingdom, and Spain. 
67	This network consists of more than 4,400 high to medium voltage substations and more than 1.5 million medium to low voltage distribution transformers, built and operated to provide a high quality and reliable service to a total of 31 million electricity supply points. 
68	This year, Iberdrola celebrates 15 years of innovation in the energy sector through its PERSEO startup programme. 
69	This has helped the utility to launch innovative solutions to promote renewable energies, decarbonisation and electrification of the economy, digitalisation of grids, promotion of efficient storage and care for the environment. 
70	The initiative, with eight companies currently in its portfolio, has created a global ecosystem of startups over the years with an investment of more than €100 million. 
71	The programme’s ecosystem includes more than 7,500 startups, including unicorns – companies valued at more than $1 billion – such as electric vehicle charging solutions manufacturer Wallbox and Stem, which offers smart battery storage solutions.  
72	Pilot projects give startups access to large volumes of data and real energy assets by testing their technologies in a real-world environment, while at the same time offering investment to startups with the highest growth potential. 
73	These two formulas provide insight into the market and access to key technologies first-hand.
