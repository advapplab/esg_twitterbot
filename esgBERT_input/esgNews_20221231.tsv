0	"Author's note: These insights are derived from roundtable discussions held in April and May through the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation’s Capital Equipment Coalition North America  initiative — a multi-stakeholder effort to reduce the environmental footprint of durable goods through information sharing and collaboration.As more companies explore and implement circular business models, such as lease/rental models, pay for performance and ""Everything-as-a-Service"" (XaaS), they are discovering a range of unexpected challenges and opportunities for how circularity is affecting all aspects of their traditional business models. "
1	This year, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation’s Capital Equipment Coalition North America  brought together dozens of leaders from 23 companies to compare notes on what they are seeing and learn from each other on successfully navigating the transition to the circular economy. 
2	Here are a few key themes from the discussions. 
3	Theme 1: Customers are interested in circular offerings for both financial and sustainability reasons, but the relative importance of each varies based on size and geography.  
4	In terms of what is bringing customers to the table for circular product offerings, companies reported that their customers are interested in both the financial and sustainability benefits of circularity, but that these are prioritized differently depending on how large the company is and where they are located. 
5	Smaller companies were seen as more interested in the financial savings that circular offerings can provide, perhaps because they are less likely to have sustainability or circularity goals that stakeholders are holding them accountable to meet. 
6	In contrast, larger companies, particularly Fortune 500 companies with climate-focused shareholders, emphasized the importance of sustainability and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions. 
7	These companies are looking to circular solutions to help them meet these goals, although it was noted that the ability to measure and report on these impacts is essential to supporting this value proposition. 
8	Geography was also a factor in how companies prioritize and value circularity. 
9	European Union regulation is driving companies in Europe to ask for more circular offerings and, in some cases, require remanufactured or refurbished goods in Requests for Proposal. 
10	In contrast, companies in the U.S. may not be as aware of or interested in circularity, and many are in the early stages of exploring XaaS models — which allow the original manufacturers to maintain product ownership and lifecycle responsibility — or other circular offerings. 
11	Theme 2: Companies are encountering a range of challenges as they shift from selling traditional linear models to providing customers with new circular offerings. 
12	Theme 3: There are at least eight potential elements of value propositions for circular offerings.  
13	What are customers finding most compelling in considering circular products and services? 
14	Companies reported these seven aspects of circular offerings were of greatest interest to the customers they spoke to, with each company bringing their own prioritization of these elements to the relationship. 
15	Theme 4: Companies providing circular products and services are still learning and figuring out their own ways to optimize value from circularity.  
16	When shaping the value proposition for customers, producers and companies providing circular business models can optimize their own value from these offerings. 
17	Despite the various motivations, priorities and value propositions companies have around circularity, it was clear from the roundtable discussion that across the technology and manufacturing sectors, there is growing interest in circularity and circular business models. 
18	Whether companies seek cost savings, working to meet sustainability goals, deepen customer relationships or strengthen their value proposition, circularity is driving new ways of thinking to accomplish these goals. 
19	If there was one thing everyone agreed on, continued dialogue and collaboration are key to everyone’s success.

22	"3M has promised to stop making and using harmful ""forever chemicals"" across its product portfolio by the end of 2025, with the manufacturing giant admitting growing regulatory, consumer and investor concerns over the use of such substances have ""increasingly weighed on our business results in recent years."" "
23	Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been used for decades to make a huge range of products — from non-stick frying pans and clothing to mobile phones and packaging — but evidence has continued to mount over their harmful consequences for planetary and human health. 
24	Exposure to PFAS has been linked to a raft of health issues including cancers, low birth weights and cardiovascular problems. 
25	They have gained the nickname forever chemicals due to their hardy nature, as they do not break down easily and have therefore been found in harmful quantities in water, soil, food and even in the human body, prompting calls for their manufacture and use to be banned altogether. 
26	The European Union has already indicated it plans to potentially restrict all PFAS from 2025, while the U.S. is reportedly considering placing limits on the level of such substances permitted in drinking water. 
27	Canada, Australia and several Asian nations are also reportedly considering action to curb the use of PFAS. 
28	In a bid to get ahead of looming regulatory restrictions, 3M in late December unveiled its own plan to phase out the use and manufacture of PFAS altogether by 2025, in a move it said was motivated by its growing need to satisfy demands from regulators, consumers and its investors. 
29	The phase-out is expected to cost the company up to $2.3 billion, 3M suggested. 
30	Currently, the company generates around $1.3 billion in sales each year from making the chemicals. 
31	"However, the firm said it had been prompted to act in view of an ""evolving external landscape"" that was beginning to see the regulatory walls closing in on PFAS worldwide, as well as increasing customer and consumer appetite for more environmentally sustainable materials and chemicals.It also cited ""the challenges of managing businesses and operations with products based on PFAS,"" which it said had ""increasingly weighed on our business results in recent years.""3M nevertheless argued PFAS would continue to be ""essential for modern life and can be safely made and used,"" but that from now on its own focus would be on ""applying our science to improve lives and make the greatest impact for out stakeholders.""Ultimately, though, 3M stressed the move to phase out PFAS was a business decision that would help to ""position our company for sustainable growth by optimizing our portfolio, continuing to innovate for our customers and delivering long-term value for our shareholders."" ""We have already reduced our use of PFAS over the past three years through ongoing research and development and will continue to innovate new solutions for customers,"" the company said in a statement. "
32	"3M's announcement follows similar pledges to phase-out PFAS substances made by a range of firms including McDonald's and Burger King, as well as U.K. supermarkets such as ASDA and the Co-op.Laurie Valeriano, executive director of U.S. green group Toxic-Free Future, gave 3M's announcement a cautious welcome, but called on the company and the wider sector to be ""transparent and only make the safest products based on green chemistry."" ""3M should not get any more chances to pollute drinking water, people and wildlife and must be held accountable for its contamination,"" she said.The news comes just weeks after a group of 47 investment firms with $8 trillion of assets under management wrote to the CEOs of the world's largest chemicals firms  to voice their concerns over the continued manufacture and use of forever chemicals."
33	"""We encourage you to lead, not be led, by phasing out and substituting these chemicals,"" the letter stated. "
34	"""In addition to the financial risks associated with litigation, producers of persistent chemicals face the risk of increased costs associated with reformulating products and modifying processes, which can have significant implications for company performance."""
35	Taiwan’s central bank said on Friday it would begin incorporating climate change risks into its modelling and forecasts for inflation and economic growth and adapt monetary policy to promote sustainable development. 
36	Taiwan said last year it intended to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and the government has pledged to spend T$900 billion ($29 billion) by 2030 towards that end. 
37	The central bank, in a statement on climate change, pointed to the risk of “green swan” events, referring to an unexpected environmental catastrophe connected with global warming and pollution that would trigger a financial crisis. 
38	Other central banks around the world have already incorporated global warming into their planning, and Taiwan would follow suit, the central bank added.See related article: Taiwan Innotech Forum 2022: The actions from Taiwan to pursue sustainability and net zero The bank said it would “incorporate weather factors into forecast models and analyse their impact on forecasts such as prices and GDP growth”. 
39	The bank would also “establish an overall model related to climate change at the industry level” to gain an in-depth understanding of the impact of climate change risks on the economy and finance. 
40	It added that it would use monetary policy tools to help promote sustainable financial development.Source: Reuters
