0	The southwestern city of Chongqing was the latest frontline of Xi Jinping’s “zero Covid” war, until it came to epitomize China’s potentially devastating about-face that has cracked the Communist Party’s edifice of absolute control.The city last month was enduring one of the biggest outbreaks cropping up across China, when the national leader, Mr. Xi, ordered officials to continue mass testing, lockdowns and quarantines. 
1	Chen Min’er, the Chongqing party secretary, devoutly complied, closing off neighborhoods and ordering the instant construction of a quarantine hospital designed to hold up to 21,000 beds .
2	“Be resolute in fighting and winning this war of annihilation against the pandemic,” Mr. Chen, a protégé of Mr. Xi, told officials on Nov. 27. 
3	“Not a day of delay.”But 10 days later, China suddenly abandoned  the “zero Covid” strategy on which Mr. Xi had staked his reputation. 
4	Now the country faces a surge of infections, and Mr. Xi has left officials scrambling to manage the disarray and uncertainty.China’s party-run media has cast the shift as a stressful but well-considered exit, opening the way back to good economic times. 
5	Warnings about the dangers of the coronavirus have swiftly disappeared, replaced by official claims that the Omicron variant is generally mild. 
6	By holding off from easing until now, the government has saved many lives, The People’s Daily said on Thursday in a long article defending Mr. Xi’s pandemic strategy as “totally correct.” 
7	In reality, an examination of how the shift unfolded in Chongqing and elsewhere reveals a government overtaken by a cascade of Covid outbreaks, confusion over directives, economic woes and then rare political protests.Mr. 
8	Xi had contrasted his prior pandemic success with the “chaos of the West,” brandishing it as proof of his grand narrative  of a rising China: orderly, secure, farsighted. 
9	But he had no plan for measured retreat from “zero Covid,” leaving a bewildered populace to improvise after three years of being micromanaged. 
10	The government is racing to approve vaccines and to obtain Western medicines after shunning them. 
11	Officials, long focused on eliminating cases, are struggling to marshal resources to treat an explosion of infections. 
12	Even the Chinese Communist Party, a virtuoso at controlling the narrative, is finding it difficult to sell the policy lurch to anxious residents. 
13	This weekend, the streets of Chinese cities remained quiet, except for throngs of people at hospitals for Covid tests or treatment, an eerie reprise of Wuhan three years ago, when that city was the first gripped by the virus. 
14	“It’s overall been quite chaotic, and of course part of that is the number coming down positive — about one-third of people, to judge from my friends,” said Tan Gangqiang, a psychological counselor in Chongqing who has helped residents with the stresses of lockdowns, and now, of sudden opening.
15	“There are many people who have been living under the official propaganda for a long time, so after being released they feel at a loss about what to do,” he said. 
16	“There are even some who hope that the government will restore controls.” 
17	Mr. Xi’s own formula for beating back Covid may have inadvertently set China up for this jolting and potentially devastating turn. 
18	He turned China’s intense top-to-bottom mobilization against the pandemic into a showcase of the party’s organizational strength. 
19	For two years, his Covid war enjoyed widespread public acceptance, but eventually the effort exhausted staff, strained local finances, and appeared to drown out attempts to discuss, let alone devise, a measured transition. 
20	Mr. Xi has no likely successor and could stay in power for at least another decade. 
21	But the scars from the abrupt change may feed distrust in his domineering style.
22	“The whipsaw speed of this shift is partially the extent to which this is the decision of one man. But also it’s officials trying to please that one man, and trying to run where you think he’s headed — sprint, in fact,” said Jeremy L. Wallace, an associate professor at Cornell University, whose book, Seeking Truth and Hiding Facts , examines China’s political transformation under Mr. Xi. 
23	Many sensed change was in the air after protests across Chinese cities in late November against pandemic restrictions. 
24	Few, though, expected a reversal from the “zero Covid” strategy enshrined as essential to protecting China’s 1.4 billion people from a storm of infections.On Nov. 28, during the protests, China’s news agency, Xinhua, had called the strategy a “magic weapon for victory.”Around the same time, Sun Chunlan, the Chinese vice premier overseeing Covid policy, told officials to “remain steadfast.” 
25	Then, as she gathered on Nov. 30 with health experts and officials who had been vocal defenders of zero Covid, the tone changed.
26	“Our fight against the pandemic is at a new stage and comes with new tasks,” said Ms. Sun  at the meeting of the National Health Commission. 
27	Strikingly, she didn’t use the term “zero Covid,” one of the first hints that the country was relinquishing its long-held approach.Even before the protests, the strategy had been under severe stress. 
28	By late November, outbreaks were ripping through more than 200 cities. 
29	On Nov. 7, national authorities confirmed 5,496 Covid cases; by Nov. 27 it was nearly 40,000 , a record high for daily cases in the country. 
30	The pooled P.C.R. testing that was a pillar of “zero Covid” — checking samples from 20 or more people in the same test tube as a quick, cheap way to find infections — stopped working in some cities. 
31	Too many positive results were clogging the queue for follow-up tests to pinpoint the carriers. 
32	In Beijing, results were taking days to come back.
33	“It was in too many cities; it was spreading too far,” said Rodney Jones, the principal at Wigram Capital Advisors, a firm that has closely monitored China’s cases. 
34	“It was a question of when would they recognize that reality.” 
35	The economy was also battered. 
36	Shoppers stayed home, either locked down or trying to avoid quarantine for accidentally passing through a designated viral hot spot. 
37	Retail sales were down almost 6 percent in November compared with a year earlier. 
38	Housing prices continued a long slide. 
39	Mr. Xi has argued that Covid controls, while burdensome, had protected China’s economy and health, to the envy of the world. 
40	But the distress was starting to translate into one of the party’s greatest fears: worker unrest.In Zhengzhou in central China, thousands of workers clashed with police  at an iPhone plant, angry about a delay in bonuses and the handling of an outbreak.In Haizhu, a textile manufacturing district in southern China, laborers poured onto the streets  over food shortages and hardships under lockdown. 
41	Migrant workers, who depend on daily work for their livelihoods, went weeks without jobs.
42	“I couldn’t make a living this year,” said Zhou Kaice, a street porter in Chongqing. 
43	“Some bosses I worked for started up for a few days but were then shut by lockdowns.” 
44	Despite the strains, officials still insisted China must win its pandemic war. 
45	Provincial leaders throughout November declared their commitment to “zero Covid,” often citing Mr. Xi as their lodestone.
46	“If pandemic controls were loosened, that would inevitably create mass infections,” said a Xinhua editorial on Nov. 19. 
47	“Economic and social development and the public’s physical health and safety would be seriously hurt.” 
48	Even if city leaders understood the challenges, Shanghai’s experience stood as a warning against experimentation in Covid policy. 
49	Officials there initially tried to avoid a citywide shutdown that would drag down China’s economy, preferring more fine-grained closures. 
50	One early lockdown area applied to a single milk tea shop.But as cases of the fast-spreading Omicron variant multiplied, central government officials reversed course and demanded a citywide lockdown , which ended up lasting two months.
51	“Many officials would have looked at Shanghai and decided it’s still ‘zero Covid’ no matter what,” said Patricia Thornton, a professor of Chinese politics at the University of Oxford. 
52	“War is a binary — you’re either at war or you’re not at war.”Ms. 
53	Sun remained insistent when she visited Chongqing in late November to inspect its pandemic measures, including the hospital under construction. 
54	The city’s efforts to identify and isolate infected people were showing results, she said .
55	“The rapid rise of the outbreak has been effectively contained,” Ms. Sun said, according to a report released Nov. 27 , the last day of her visit. 
56	By then, China’s most widespread protests since 1989 had begun. 
57	Students, workers and homeowners in Beijing, Shanghai and elsewhere vented against Covid controls, angered by a fire in western China that many believed, despite official denials, had killed residents trapped in their apartments by lockdowns.
58	“I tell you that in this world there’s only one sickness, and that’s poverty and having no freedom, and we’ve got plenty of that,” said a Chongqing man whose tirade went viral in China . 
59	“Give me liberty or give me death,” he shouted, using the Chinese version of the American revolutionary battle cry. 
60	Mr. Xi told the visiting European Council president, Charles Michel, on Dec. 1 that the protests were driven mainly by frustrated youth who had borne the brunt of lockdowns, according to two officials with knowledge of the talks. 
61	Nefarious forces, Mr. Xi added, had tried to piggyback off them to destabilize the country.But the swiftness of the government’s actions belied Mr. Xi’s sang-froid. 
62	Six days after the meeting with Mr. Michel, China’s National Health Commission released a new set of 10 rules that effectively dismantled “zero Covid.” 
63	While economic and epidemiological realities were forcing leaders to reassess their pandemic controls, the protests appeared to heighten fear that continued restrictions would ignite more demonstrations, without stifling the virus.
64	“The scale of the protests really seemed to send a powerful message that ‘enough is enough and it’s time to change’,” said Dali Yang , a professor of political science at the University of Chicago who has studied China’s handling of the pandemic. 
65	In the following days, officials issued many new rules: encouraging vaccinations, setting rules for protecting old age homes and other vulnerable sites, preparing villages for infections. 
66	Their message about Covid, especially the fast-moving variant, flipped from alarm to tut-tutting at any fears.
67	“The virulence of the novel coronavirus’ Omicron strain has clearly fallen, and most people infected only show light or no symptoms,” Wang Guiqiang, a medical expert, told a government news conference  a day after the rule changes. 
68	For now, most people are staying home, either because they have Covid or fear getting it. 
69	But if deaths rise sharply, public anger could revive. 
70	Coming infections could hinder a quick economic rebound.In Chongqing, at least some medical teams have left the just-built quarantine hospital, its future use unclear. 
71	A doctor in a city hospital said on social media that “primary care has exploded” with Covid patients, and more than half the doctors and nurses in the respiratory disease section were infected. 
72	Mr. Chen, the city’s party secretary, transferred to another city on Dec. 8 , part of a wider reshuffle among local leaders.
73	“Many people have told me that I’m giving up just before dawn breaks,” said Sisi Shi, a business owner in Chongqing who decided this month to close a restaurant she owns in another Chinese city, Dali. 
74	“But in my judgment, even with opening up, there won’t be an instant revival, because there’ll be wave after wave of shocks.”Additional reporting and research by Li You, Matina Stevis-Gridneff and Olivia Wang .
75	The days of paying to pet lion and tiger cubs, as portrayed in the hit Netflix documentary television series “Tiger King,” are officially over in the United States.On Tuesday, President Biden signed a bill into law  that seeks to halt the exploitation of big cats by preventing unlicensed people from owning, breeding and transporting these animals. 
76	The law also bans licensed exhibitors — mainly zoos and sanctuaries — from allowing the public to touch the animals or hold cubs.
77	“Tiger King,” which captivated viewers stuck at home in 2020, shone a light on the fraught world of private big cat ownership and highlighted the “miserable conditions thousands of tigers, lions, leopards, and pumas are kept in by irresponsible owners,” Representative Mike Quigley, Democrat of Illinois, said in a statement . 
78	The seven-part series depicted a turbulent industry of roadside zoo attractions in the U.S. and zoomed in on a now-shuttered facility in Oklahoma once operated by Joseph Maldonado-Passage, a colorful character who also goes by the name Joe Exotic. 
79	The show also focused on simmering discord between Mr. Maldonado-Passage and Carole Baskin, a self-described animal rights activist often clad in animal-print apparel who denounced Mr. Maldonado-Passage’s zoo.At that zoo, G.W. Exotic Animal Park, which once promoted Groupon admission deals,  customers could pay to cuddle with baby cubs and take photos with them. 
80	The “Tiger King” footage included a scene of a cub being separated from its mother shortly after birth.In January 2021, several months after the show’s release, Mr. Quigley introduced the “Big Cat Public Safety Act,” which in July of this year passed in the House of Representatives  with a 278-134 vote and then in the Senate unanimously earlier this month. 
81	The animals covered under the bill are species of lion, tiger, leopard, cheetah, jaguar, cougar and hybrids of these cats.The new law will “not only help end the cruel and inhumane cub petting industry,” Mr. Quigley said in a statement , but also keep communities safer.Animal rights advocates celebrated the legislation, which they described as long overdue. 
82	Sara Amundson, president of the Humane Society Legislative Fund, said that the law ended “a warped industry with no socially redeeming purpose, perpetrating great harm to animals while putting Americans at risk every day of the year.” 
83	Ms. Amundson added that the bill would put a stop to what she called “an endless cycle of exploiting and mistreating big cat cubs, who were dumped after they grew too large for photo ops.” 
84	In the last two decades, more than 400 “dangerous incidents” involving big cats occurred in 46 states and the District of Columbia, including at least 24 deaths, according to the Humane Society of the United States. 
85	Under the new law, owners of big cats have 180 days to register their animals with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. 
86	People who fail to do so face a fine of up to $20,000 or five years in prison.In 2018, Mr. Maldonado-Passage was arrested after he tried twice the prior year, unsuccessfully, to hire people  to kill Ms. Baskin. 
87	Mr. Maldonado-Passage paid an employee $3,000 to cut off Ms. Baskin’s head, according to court records. 
88	In a second attempt, he made the grave blunder of hiring an undercover F.B.I. agent.He was also found guilty of falsifying wildlife records  and violating the Endangered Species Act for his role in trafficking and killing tigers.Mr. 
89	Maldonado-Passage, who maintains his innocence, is now serving 21 years in prison .
90	Ms. 
91	Baskin, who is the chief executive and founder of a Tampa, Fla.-based organization called Big Cat Rescue, told The New York Times that she viewed the bill’s passage as “the greatest achievement in my 30 years of working to stop mistreatment of big cats.”She also said in a statement that the bill came after “many years of battling against narcissistic, abusive, dangerous men who dominated this cruel trade and did everything they could to stop its passage, including wanting to intimidate, discredit, and even kill me.”She expressed gratitude for being “harder to intimidate or kill than some thought.”
92	Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the incoming House Democratic leader, on Wednesday accused Representative-elect George Santos of being a “complete and utter fraud,” as a new report cast doubt on Mr. Santos’s account of his Jewish descent.
93	“His whole life. Made up,” Mr. Jeffries said at a news conference in Washington. 
94	“Did you perpetrate a fraud on voters of the Third Congressional District of New York?”Hours before Mr. Jeffries spoke, The Forward, a Jewish publication based in New York City, reported that Mr. Santos, a Republican, may have misled voters about having Jewish ancestry, a claim he made  on his website and in statements during his political campaign.In his current biography, Mr. Santos says that his mother, Fatima Devolder, was born in Brazil to immigrants who “fled Jewish persecution in Ukraine, settled in Belgium, and again fled persecution during WWII.”But according to The Forward — which cited information from myheritage.com, a genealogy website; Brazilian immigration cards; and databases of refugees — Ms. Devolder’s parents seemed to have been born in Brazil before World War II. 
95	CNN later published a similar report  that also cited interviews with several genealogists.Ms. 
96	Devolder died in 2016, according to an online obituary . 
97	Mr. Santos said in a 2020 interview that his family converted to Christianity in Brazil, and on Ms. Devolder’s Facebook page, which links to Mr. Santos’s, she regularly shared Christian imagery and had “liked” numerous Facebook pages associated with Brazil-based Christian organizations. 
98	Mr. Santos’s campaign, his lawyer and a political consulting firm that had been fielding reporter inquiries did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Republican Jewish Coalition, an influential conservative group that has hosted Mr. Santos and billed him as a Jewish Republican , said that it had reached out to Mr. Santos’s office regarding The Forward’s reporting.
99	“These allegations, if true, are deeply troubling,” the coalition’s director, Matt Brooks, said. 
100	“Given their seriousness, the congressman-elect owes the public an explanation, and we look forward to hearing it.”Mr. 
101	Santos, whose victory in a district covering parts of Long Island and Queens helped his party secure a narrow majority in the House next year, has not directly answered questions about his background raised by an article in The New York Times  earlier this week. 
102	The Times’s report found that Mr. Santos may have misled voters about key details of his résumé that were on his campaign website at various points during his two bids for Congress, including his college graduation and his purported career on Wall Street. 
103	It also found that Mr. Santos did not include key details about his business, the Devolder Organization, on financial disclosure forms. 
104	The Devolder Organization, which was registered in 2021 in Florida, had been dissolved by state officials in September after it failed to file an annual report. 
105	On Tuesday, Mr. Santos filed paperwork to reinstate it.The claim that Mr. Santos’s maternal grandparents fled Jewish persecution was added to his campaign website sometime between April and October, according to a review of the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine. 
106	An earlier version of Mr. Santos’s biography said simply that Mr. Santos’s maternal grandparents “fled the devastation of World War II Europe.”Though Mr. Santos has identified as Catholic, he has more often trumpeted his Jewish heritage on the campaign trail, even as he described himself as a nonobservant Jew. 
107	As early as June 2020, when he was making his first bid for Congress, he wrote on Twitter that he was the “grandson of Holocaust refugees.”On Sunday night, Mr. Santos attended a Hanukkah party on Long Island being held by the Republican Jewish Coalition. 
108	He also spoke last month at the coalition’s annual leadership meeting  in Las Vegas. 
109	In his remarks in Washington, Mr. Jeffries did not address the new questions about Mr. Santos’s heritage. 
110	But he said that The Times’s reporting left him with doubts as to Mr. Santos’s suitability for office that he believed the House minority leader, Representative Kevin McCarthy, needed to address. 
111	“It’s an open question to me as to whether this is the type of individual that the incoming majority should welcome to Congress,” Mr. Jeffries said. 
112	Mr. McCarthy, the top House Republican, who is trying to shore up support for his bid to become the House’s next speaker, has not commented on The Times’s findings. 
113	A spokesman for Mr. McCarthy has not responded to emails or phone calls about Mr. Santos, who voiced his support for Mr. McCarthy’s potential speakership hours after The Times warned him of its report on Sunday night.Legal experts have said it is unlikely that the House of Representatives could deny Mr. Santos his seat in Congress. 
114	There are procedures that allow losing candidates to contest  the results of a House election. 
115	But a Supreme Court decision in 1969 limited the House from preventing candidates from taking office unless they did not meet the Constitution’s age, citizenship and state residency requirements. 
116	Some Democrats and government watchdog groups have called for further investigation of Mr. Santos’s past claims and financial disclosure forms, either by the bipartisan Office of Congressional Ethics or by federal prosecutors. 
117	Representative-elect Dan Goldman, a Democrat from New York City and a former assistant U.S. attorney, said in an interview on Wednesday that he believed there were two possible federal crimes that prosecutors should investigate. 
118	The first issue, he said, was whether Mr. Santos had willfully and intentionally made false statements in his financial disclosure forms. 
119	Such a violation, he said, would require investigators to make sure that there was a clear and knowing intent to omit or misrepresent information. 
120	“As someone who had to make those disclosures, they’re done under penalty of perjury,” Mr. Goldman said. 
121	But Mr. Goldman, who was the chief investigator in the first impeachment case against former President Donald J. Trump, said that he believed the authorities should explore whether Mr. Santos’s apparent misstatements could be considered part of a conspiracy to defraud the United States.Such a charge would be an aggressive approach, Mr. Goldman said. 
122	(It was used on Monday by the committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol against Mr. Trump, whom Mr. Santos has previously backed.) 
123	Prosecutors would need to prove that Mr. Santos had interfered with a federal election by willfully disseminating misinformation, and that he had worked with others to do so. 
124	“I think it’s worthy of investigation to see whether his efforts to repeatedly and pervasively lie about pretty much anything rises to the level of an effort to defraud the voters of his district to vote for him,” Mr. Goldman said.
125	Perhaps you missed the big news: In 2023, there will be a record-breaking 12 women serving as governors around the nation. 
126	Way over the previous record of … nine.And your reaction is: Hey, that’s 24 percent — not bad.That’s less than a quarter!
127	Are any of them going to run for president? 
128	And does that mean we have to discuss Kamala Harris? 
129	Because I’m really not sure. 
130	… OK, one thing at a time, please. 
131	Just think of 2023 as the Year of Women Governors. 
132	Even so, we’ve still got a way to go. 
133	Eighteen states have yet to select a woman governor, ever. 
134	California! 
135	Pennsylvania! 
136	And Florida — really Florida, there’s a limit to how much time we’ve got to complain about you. 
137	New York elected a woman for the first time last month, a development that began when then-Lt. 
138	Gov. Kathy Hochul was propelled into the job because of Andrew Cuomo’s sexual harassment scandal. 
139	Sorry, Andrew, but history may well recall this as your final gift to New Yorkers. 
140	Arizona hasn’t gotten enough attention — electing Katie Hobbs as its fifth female governor kept it the national record-holder. 
141	Good work, guys! 
142	It was also one of the states with a woman-vs.
143	-woman race, although being Arizona, it featured a crazy subplot. 
144	Kari Lake, the defeated Republican Trumpophile, is taking the whole thing to court.It’s important to admit that while the quantity of female governors expands, the quality is … varied. 
145	Current incumbents include the newly re-elected Kristi Noem of South Dakota, whose attitude toward Covid vaccination has been, at best, deeply unenthusiastic. 
146	(Noem spent $5 million of pandemic relief funds on ads to promote tourism.)On the other side, there’s Michigan’s current governor, Gretchen Whitmer, who led the Democrats to a monster statewide sweep last month. 
147	She went through a lot to do it — remember when a group called Wolverine Watchmen plotted to kidnap her and put her on trial for treason? 
148	Our female governors, both incumbent and newly elected, have a wide ideological range, but it’s very possible they’ll still be more conscious of women’s issues — like child care and sexual assault — than would a group of men from similar political backgrounds. 
149	And abortion rights — although some, like Noem, are definitely not on that boat. 
150	The Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision mobilized female voters so much in the fall that you’d think we’d be seeing more women out there carrying the flag in the governors’ races. 
151	“It may well have come down too late to see candidacies emerge as a result,” said Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, who’s hoping the surge will still be coming. 
152	If so, it’ll be the next chapter in a saga that goes back a century — the first two women ever elected governor won their jobs in 1925, in Wyoming and Texas. 
153	The Wyoming winner, Nellie Tayloe Ross, was the widow of the prior governor. 
154	When he died, his party nominated her to succeed him before she’d decided to run. 
155	She won anyhow and apparently liked the job. 
156	Ross ran for re-election and lost but went on to forge a successful career as director of the U.S. Mint. 
157	Wyoming, however, has never since chosen a woman as governor. 
158	Get a move on, Wyoming. 
159	The other woman who became governor a century ago was a little less, um, encouraging. 
160	Texas’ Miriam “Ma” Ferguson also succeeded her husband — who was, in this case, impeached. 
161	“Ma” basically vowed to carry on her husband’s not-totally-reputable practices. 
162	Elect her, she promised voters, and get “two for the price of one.” 
163	That, you may remember, is what Bill Clinton said when he ran for president in 1992 — pick him and get Hillary as well. 
164	It worked a lot better for the couple from Arkansas than it did for the couple in Texas. 
165	Ma Ferguson won, and voters got a governor who pardoned an average of 100 convicts a month. 
166	Most did not appear to be worthy of release on any basis other than cold cash. 
167	But hey, she was definitely carrying on a family tradition. 
168	The first woman elected governor in her own right was Ella Grasso in Connecticut. 
169	That was in 1974 and I was in Hartford at the time, starting out my career covering the state legislature. 
170	My clients were little papers who forked over a tiny bit of money to hear what their lawmakers were up to. 
171	The regular pressroom decreed there was no room for any newcomers, and I was dispatched — along with my partner, Trish Hall — to work out of the Capitol attic. 
172	The other facilities in said attic included a men-only bar for legislators. 
173	The 35 women in the legislature at the time didn’t seem upset about discrimination when it came to access to drinking quarters. 
174	Possibly because the facility in question, known as the Hawaiian Room, was a dark, moldy space with dusty plastic leis hanging from the ceiling. 
175	But I did complain about having to work in the attic, and one night when I was there alone — it was really pretty late — Ella Grasso herself showed up to check the accommodations. 
176	As she was walking down the narrow room, a bat flew down from the ceiling and into her hair. 
177	She took it very well.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

182	On Nov. 30, 2020, Sean Hannity hosted Sidney Powell on his prime-time Fox News program. 
183	As she had in many other interviews around that time — on Fox and elsewhere in right-wing media — Ms. Powell, a former federal prosecutor, spun wild conspiracy theories about what she said was “corruption all across the country, in countless districts,” in a plot to steal re-election from the president, Donald J. Trump.At the center of this imagined plot were machines from Dominion Voting Systems, which Ms. Powell claimed ran an algorithm that switched votes for Mr. Trump to votes for Joseph R. Biden Jr. 
184	Dominion machines, she insisted, were being used “to trash large batches of votes.”Mr. 
185	Hannity interrupted her with a gentle question that had been circulating among election deniers, despite a lack of supporting proof: Why were Democrats silencing whistle-blowers who could prove this fraud?
186	Did Mr. Hannity believe any of this?
187	“I did not believe it for one second.” 
188	That was the answer Mr. Hannity gave, under oath, in a deposition in Dominion’s $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against Fox News, according to information disclosed in a court hearing on Wednesday. 
189	The hearing was called to address several issues that need to be resolved before the case heads for a jury trial, which the judge has scheduled to begin in April. 
190	Mr. Hannity’s disclosure — along with others that emerged from court on Wednesday about what Fox News executives and hosts really believed as their network became one of the loudest megaphones for lies about the 2020 election — is among the strongest evidence yet to emerge publicly that some Fox employees knew that what they were broadcasting was false. 
191	The high legal standard of proof in defamation cases makes it difficult for a company like Dominion to prevail against a media organization like Fox News. 
192	Dominion has to persuade a jury that people at Fox were, in effect, saying one thing in private while telling their audience exactly the opposite. 
193	And that requires showing a jury convincing evidence that speaks to the state of mind of those who were making the decisions at the network. 
194	In Delaware Superior Court on Wednesday, Dominion’s lawyers argued that they had obtained ample evidence to make that case. 
195	One lawyer for Dominion said that “not a single Fox witness” so far had produced anything supporting the various false claims about the company that were uttered repeatedly on the network. 
196	And in some cases, other high-profile hosts and senior executives echoed Mr. Hannity’s doubts about what Mr. Trump and his allies like Ms. Powell were saying, according to the Dominion lawyer, Stephen Shackelford. 
197	This included Meade Cooper, who oversees prime-time programming for Fox News, and the prime-time star Tucker Carlson, Mr. Shackelford said. 
198	“Many of the highest-ranking Fox people have admitted under oath that they never believed the Dominion lies,” he said, naming both Ms. Cooper and Mr. Carlson. 
199	Mr. Shackelford described how Mr. Carlson had “tried to squirm out of it at his deposition” when asked about what he really believed. 
200	Mr. Shackelford started to elaborate about what Mr. Carlson had said privately, telling the judge about the existence of text messages the host had sent in November and December of 2020. 
201	But the judge, Eric M. Davis, cut him off, leaving the specific contents of those texts unknown. 
202	A spokeswoman for Fox News declined to comment. 
203	Another previously unknown detail emerged on Wednesday about what was going on inside the Fox universe in those frantic weeks after the election. 
204	A second lawyer representing Dominion, Justin Nelson, told Judge Davis about evidence obtained by Dominion showing that an employee of the Fox Corporation, the parent company of Fox News, had tried to intervene with the White House to stop Ms. Powell. 
205	According to Mr. Nelson, that employee called the fraud claims “outlandish” and pressed Mr. Trump’s staff to get rid of Ms. Powell, who was advising the president on filing legal challenges to the results.Mr. 
206	Nelson said that evidence cut straight to the heart of whether the Fox Corporation, which is controlled by Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, was also liable for defamation. 
207	Judge Davis ruled in June  that Dominion could sue the larger, highly profitable corporation, which includes the Fox network on basic television and a lucrative sports broadcasting division. 
208	A spokesman for the Fox Corporation declined to comment. 
209	Over the last several months, Dominion has been combing through mountains of private email and text messages from people at every level of Fox News and the Fox Corporation — hosts like Mr. Hannity, senior executives and midlevel producers. 
210	A lawyer for Fox, Dan K. Webb, said on Wednesday that the company had produced more than 52,000 documents for Dominion, with more to come. 
211	During the hearing, the judge was asked to rule on several issues. 
212	One was whether a second voting company that is suing Fox for defamation, Smartmatic, could be given access to the documents Dominion had obtained for its case. 
213	Judge Davis ruled in Fox’s favor, denying Smartmatic’s motion. 
214	A second issue was whether certain evidence that Dominion has used against Fox in its court filings — including emails among Fox employees and a page from a deposition in which someone from Fox describes the journalistic processes of one of the network’s programs — should be made public. 
215	Throughout the case, Fox has asked the court to keep almost everything in the case pertaining to its inner workings under seal. 
216	A third lawyer for Dominion, Davida Brook, argued on Wednesday that the public had a fundamental right to see what it had filed with the court in the interest of fostering the openness that a democracy requires. 
217	Judge Davis disagreed, ruling that the evidence would stay under seal. 
218	But he admonished the lawyers that neither party in the case should be overly aggressive in trying to keep facts in the case confidential. 
219	If, for instance, someone says something “not bright” — and therefore embarrassing — that wouldn’t be enough to keep that information under seal, Judge Davis said. 
220	“That’s too bad,” he said.
221	Under Armour named Stephanie Linnartz, president of Marriott International, its new chief executive officer on Wednesday, seven months after Patrik Frisk stepped down from the top role at the sportswear giant.Ms. 
222	Linnartz is the third permanent chief executive in Under Armour’s 22-year history but the second since 2019, when the founder, Kevin Plank , stepped away from overseeing day-to-day activities. 
223	Mr. Plank will remain executive chair and brand chief.
224	“Under Armour is an iconic brand with a huge opportunity ahead,” Ms. Linnartz said in a statement. 
225	“This company has immense energy and excitement.” 
226	Ms. Linnartz will take over on Feb. 27, the company said. 
227	She has worked at Marriott since 1997, helping to establish its website and app as ways to build customer loyalty. 
228	She is also on the board of directors at Home Depot.
229	“Those fresh eyes are going to be really helpful for Under Armour,” Mr. Plank said, referring to Ms. Linnartz’s experience in the hospitality industry. 
230	“We’ve got enough industry experts here at Under Armour. We’re fortunate to have a leader with the perspective that Stephanie is going to bring.” 
231	In the past few years, Under Armour has struggled to maintain the rapid growth that impressed Wall Street in its early days as a publicly traded company. 
232	Its stock has fallen 53 percent this year. 
233	In November, Under Armour lowered its outlook for the 2023 fiscal year, and several top executives have left in the past few months. 
234	The company now expects revenue to increase at a low-single-digit percentage rate, compared with an earlier forecast of 5 to 7 percent. 
235	It also now sees operating income being between $270 million and $290 million, down from the previous range of $300 million to $325 million. 
236	In the quarter that ended Sept. 30 revenue increased 2 percent.Under Armour is focused on winning back shoppers in the 16- to 20-year-old range. 
237	According to Piper Sandler’s fall survey , Under Armour dropped out of the top 10 most popular brands for teenagers.
238	“It’s time for us to put up,” Mr. Plank said. 
239	“We went through five years really of restructuring, of getting our house in order, of putting those pieces in place, and the good news through all of that is the consumer is still there for us.” 
240	Colin Browne, who was the interim chief executive, will return to his role as chief operating officer.
241	“There’s only two hands on the wheel,” Mr. Plank said, referring to the chief executive role. 
242	“Stephanie has to be the one to steer the ship.”
243	KYIV, Ukraine — Before Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, President Volodymyr Zelensky was often brushed off as a former comedian who stumbled into the job of leading a nation with the seemingly naïve promise of cleaning up Ukraine’s endemic corruption. 
244	After a quick trip Tuesday to the bloodiest theater in the war, he arrived in Washington on Wednesday a national hero and global superstar, having forged a leadership style blending personal daring with deft messaging to rally his people at home and his allies abroad. 
245	That aura has served him and his country well to this point. 
246	But Mr. Zelensky arrives in Washington at a pivotal time for Ukraine, when his troops’ lightning counteroffensives from this fall are slowing down. 
247	He will be pleading for the more powerful weapons he believes Ukraine needs, but he will have to walk a fine line. 
248	By taking a daring trip abroad during wartime, he is seeking to project strength and show confidence that Ukraine will ultimately prevail. 
249	But to make the case for continued financial and military support, he needs to draw attention to the dire threat Ukraine still faces without seeming weak.
250	“President Zelensky would like to present this trip as serious progress in the war,” Volodymyr Ariev, a member of Parliament in the opposition European Solidarity Party, said in an interview. 
251	“It’s a pretty clear message that the alliance of the United States and Ukraine is maintained and is quite strong.” 
252	In Ukraine, the visit was also seen as tied to the American political calendar, coming as control of the House passes to the Republican Party, some of whose members have voiced skepticism of continuing to funnel assistance to Ukraine. 
253	Another of Mr. Zelensky’s principal aims, analysts say, is to maintain unified American support for the war, doing whatever he can to avoid having it devolve into a partisan issue. 
254	“Zelensky should not maneuver between the Democrats and Republicans,” Yevhen Mahda, a political commentator in Kyiv, said in an interview. 
255	“He should suggest a new paradigm — the paradigm that Ukraine today is at the epicenter of the battle between good and evil.“And by supporting Ukraine, the United States supports good,” Mr. Mahda added. 
256	“This is the necessary message.” 
257	Mr. Zelensky, a former comedian, has always had a keen sense of image and storytelling in politics, which is evident in his following up a frontline visit to the eastern city of Bakhmut — with booming artillery as a backdrop — with his address to Congress.
258	“It’s an honor for me to be here today,” Mr. Zelensky had told the soldiers in Bakhmut, where Russia has been pressing a fierce offensive for months. 
259	To those with children, he said, “I wish that your sun, that is your children, will shine for you, for them to motivate you to survive, for sure, and defend your families, our families, all of our state and the future of our children.”At a news conference on Wednesday with President Biden in Washington, where he delivered a personal plea for more economic and military support, he had a similar message when asked what he would want the world to know: “I wish you peace,” he said, switching from Ukrainian to English. 
260	“And you understand it only when the war is in your country.” 
261	He added: “I wish you to see your children when they will go to universities, and to see their children.” 
262	Analysts say that Mr. Zelensky is also keenly aware that he needs to bolster the morale of his people, millions of whom are living without electricity, water or heating as winter sets in. 
263	For the most part, however, Mr. Zelensky faced no political pressure at home and was free to tailor the trip to the imperative of filling out his military’s arsenal for the war.The United States is by far the largest foreign supplier of weapons to the Ukrainian Army. 
264	But the Biden administration has carefully calibrated its assistance  to Ukraine, holding back longer-range and more powerful weapons for fear of Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory that could drag NATO into the war. 
265	Two successful Ukrainian counteroffensives in the northeast and in the south have run their course, and the Russian and Ukrainian armies are digging in along a new, 600-mile front line. 
266	To maintain that progress, Ukrainian officials and analysts say, its military needs more advanced weapons systems. 
267	Mr. Zelensky will have the opportunity to address the concerns of U.S. lawmakers about the oversight of military and financial aid to Ukraine, and he could be pushed on domestic matters like press freedom, fighting corruption and ensuring checks and balances between the courts and executive branch. 
268	But Mr. Zelensky’s major objective is to portray the war in stark terms of good versus evil that he hopes will transcend American politics and will give “a sense of the rightness of his cause and the sense of what his people and his soldiers feel,” said Yuri Makarov, the editor in chief of the Ukrainian national broadcasting company. 
269	Maria Varenikova contributed reporting from Kyiv.
270	President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine spoke before a joint meeting of Congress on Wednesday night, delivering in halting but forceful English an impassioned speech that thanked the United States for its support in his nation’s war against Russia and vowed victory as he pleaded for further aid. 
271	The following is a transcript of his remarks, as recorded by The New York Times. 
272	Thank you so much. 
273	Thank you so much for that. 
274	Thank you. 
275	It’s too much for me. 
276	All this for our great people. 
277	Thank you so much. 
278	Dear Americans, in all states, cities and communities, all those who value freedom and justice, who cherish it as strongly as we Ukrainians in our cities, in each and every family, I hope my words of respect and gratitude resonate in each American heart. 
279	Madam Vice President, I thank you for your efforts in helping Ukraine. 
280	Madam Speaker, you bravely visited Ukraine during the full-fledged war. 
281	Thank you very much. 
282	Great honor. 
283	Thank you. 
284	I am very privileged to be here. 
285	Dear members of the Congress, representatives of both parties who also visited Kyiv, esteemed congressmen and senators from both parties who will visit Ukraine, I am sure, in the future; dear representatives of diaspora, present in this chamber, and spread across the country; dear journalists, it’s a great honor for me to be at the U.S. Congress and speak to you and all Americans. 
286	Against all odds and doom-and-gloom scenarios, Ukraine didn’t fall. 
287	Ukraine is alive and kicking. 
288	Thank you. 
289	And it gives me good reason to share with you our first, first joint victory: We defeated Russia in the battle for minds of the world. 
290	We have no fear, nor should anyone in the world have it. 
291	Ukrainians gained this victory, and it gives us courage which inspires the entire world. 
292	Americans gained this victory, and that’s why you have succeeded in uniting the global community to protect freedom and international law. 
293	Europeans gained this victory, and that’s why Europe is now stronger and more independent than ever. 
294	The Russian tyranny has lost control over us. 
295	And it will never influence our minds again. 
296	Yet, we have to do whatever it takes to ensure that countries of the Global South also gain such victory. 
297	I know one more, I think very important, thing: The Russians will stand a chance to be free only when they defeat the Kremlin in their minds. 
298	Yet, the battle continues, and we have to defeat the Kremlin on the battlefield, yes. 
299	This battle is not only for the territory, for this or another part of Europe. 
300	The battle is not only for life, freedom and security of Ukrainians or any other nation which Russia attempts to conquer. 
301	This struggle will define in what world our children and grandchildren will live, and then their children and grandchildren. 
302	It will define whether it will be a democracy of Ukrainians and for Americans — for all. 
303	This battle cannot be frozen or postponed. 
304	It cannot be ignored, hoping that the ocean or something else will provide a protection. 
305	From the United States to China, from Europe to Latin America, and from Africa to Australia, the world is too interconnected and interdependent to allow someone to stay aside and at the same time to feel safe when such a battle continues. 
306	Our two nations are allies in this battle. 
307	And next year will be a turning point, I know it, the point when Ukrainian courage and American resolve must guarantee the future of our common freedom, the freedom of people who stand for their values. 
308	Ladies and gentlemen — ladies and gentlemen, Americans, yesterday before coming here to Washington, D.C., I was at the front line in our Bakhmut. 
309	In our stronghold in the east of Ukraine, in the Donbas. 
310	The Russian military and mercenaries have been taking Bakhmut nonstop since May. 
311	They have been taking it day and night, but Bakhmut stands. 
312	Last year — last year, 70,000 people lived here in Bakhmut, in this city, and now only few civilians stay. 
313	Every inch of that land is soaked in blood; roaring guns sound every hour. 
314	Trenches in the Donbas change hands several times a day in fierce combat, and even hand fighting. 
315	But the Ukrainian Donbas stands. 
316	Russians — Russians use everything, everything they have against Bakhmut and other our beautiful cities. 
317	The occupiers have a significant advantage in artillery. 
318	They have an advantage in ammunition. 
319	They have much more missiles and planes than we ever had. 
320	It’s true, but our defense forces stand. 
321	And — and we all are proud of them. 
322	The Russians’ tactic is primitive. 
323	They burn down and destroy everything they see. 
324	They sent thugs to the front lines. 
325	They sent convicts to the war. 
326	They threw everything against us, similar to the other tyranny, which is in the Battle of the Bulge. 
327	Threw everything it had against the free world, just like the brave American soldiers which held their lines and fought back Hitler’s forces during the Christmas of 1944. 
328	Brave Ukrainian soldiers are doing the same to Putin’s forces this Christmas. 
329	Ukraine — Ukraine holds its lines and will never surrender. 
330	So, so, here the front line, the tyranny which has no lack of cruelty against the lives of free people — and your support is crucial, not just to stand in such fight but to get to the turning point to win on the battlefield. 
331	We have artillery, yes. 
332	Thank you. 
333	We have it. 
334	Is it enough? 
335	Honestly, not really. 
336	To ensure Bakhmut is not just a stronghold that holds back the Russian Army, but for the Russian Army to completely pull out, more cannons and shells are needed. 
337	If so, just like the Battle of Saratoga, the fight for Bakhmut will change the trajectory of our war for independence and for freedom. 
338	If your Patriots stop the Russian terror against our cities, it will let Ukrainian patriots work to the full to defend our freedom. 
339	When Russia — when Russia cannot reach our cities by its artillery, it tries to destroy them with missile attacks. 
340	More than that, Russia found an ally in this — in this genocidal policy: Iran. 
341	Iranian deadly drones sent to Russia in hundreds — in hundreds became a threat to our critical infrastructure. 
342	That is how one terrorist has found the other. 
343	It is just a matter of time when they will strike against your other allies if we do not stop them now. 
344	We must do it. 
345	I believe there should be no taboos between us in our alliance. 
346	Ukraine never asked the American soldiers to fight on our land instead of us. 
347	I assure you that Ukrainian soldiers can perfectly operate American tanks and planes themselves. 
348	Financial assistance is also critically important, and I would like to thank you, thank you very much, thank you for both financial packages you have already provided us with and the ones you may be willing to decide on. 
349	Your money is not charity. 
350	It’s an investment in the global security and democracy that we handle in the most responsible way. 
351	Russia, Russia could stop its aggression, really, if it wanted to, but you can speed up our victory. 
352	I know it. 
353	And it, it will prove to any potential aggressor that no one can succeed in breaking national borders, no one committing atrocities and reigning over people against their will. 
354	It would be naïve to wait for steps towards peace from Russia, which enjoys being a terrorist state. 
355	Russians are still poisoned by the Kremlin. 
356	The restoration of international legal order is our joint task. 
357	We need peace, yes. 
358	Ukraine has already offered proposals, which I just discussed with President Biden, our peace formula, 10 points which should and must be implemented for our joint security, guaranteed for decades ahead and the summit which can be held. 
359	I’m glad to say that President Biden supported our peace initiative today. 
360	Each of you, ladies and gentlemen, can assist in the implementation to ensure that America’s leadership remains solid, bicameral and bipartisan. 
361	Thank you. 
362	You can strengthen sanctions to make Russia feel how ruinous its aggression truly is. 
363	It is in your power, really, to help us bring to justice everyone who started this unprovoked and criminal war. 
364	Let’s do it. 
365	Let terrorist — let the terrorist state be held responsible for its terror and aggression and compensate all losses done by this war. 
366	Let the world see that the United States are here. 
367	Ladies and gentlemen — ladies and gentlemen, Americans, in two days we will celebrate Christmas. 
368	Maybe candlelit. 
369	Not because it’s more romantic, no, but because there will not be, there will be no electricity. 
370	Millions won’t have neither heating nor running water. 
371	All of these will be the result of Russian missile and drone attacks on our energy infrastructure. 
372	But we do not complain. 
373	We do not judge and compare whose life is easier. 
374	Your well-being is the product of your national security; the result of your struggle for independence and your many victories. 
375	We, Ukrainians, will also go through our war of independence and freedom with dignity and success. 
376	We’ll celebrate Christmas. 
377	Celebrate Christmas and, even if there is no electricity, the light of our faith in ourselves will not be put out. 
378	If Russian — if Russian missiles attack us, we’ll do our best to protect ourselves. 
379	If they attack us with Iranian drones and our people will have to go to bomb shelters on Christmas Eve, Ukrainians will still sit down at the holiday table and cheer up each other. 
380	And we don’t, don’t have to know everyone’s wish, as we know that all of us, millions of Ukrainians, wish the same: Victory. 
381	Only victory. 
382	We already built strong Ukraine, with strong people, strong army, strong institutions together with you. 
383	We developed strong security guarantees for our country and for entire Europe and the world, together with you. 
384	And also together with you, we’ll put in place everyone who will defy freedom. 
385	Put-in. 
386	This will be the basis to protect democracy in Europe and the world over. 
387	Now, on this special Christmastime, I want to thank you, all of you. 
388	I thank every American family which cherishes the warmth of its home and wishes the same warmth to other people. 
389	I thank President Biden and both parties, at the Senate and the House, for your invaluable assistance. 
390	I thank your cities and your citizens who supported Ukraine this year, who hosted our Ukrainians, our people, who waved our national flags, who acted to help us. 
391	Thank you all, from everyone who is now at the front line, from everyone who is awaiting victory. 
392	Standing here today, I recall the wars of the president Franklin Delano Roosevelt, which are I think so good for this moment. 
393	The American people, in their righteous might, will win through to absolute victory. 
394	The Ukrainian people will win, too, absolutely. 
395	I know that everything depends on us, on Ukrainian armed forces, yet so much depends on the world. 
396	So much in the world depends on you. 
397	When I was in Bakhmut yesterday, our heroes gave me the flag, the battle flag, the flag of those who defend Ukraine, Europe and the world at the cost of their lives. 
398	They asked me to bring this flag to you, to the U.S. Congress, to members of the House of Representatives and senators whose decisions can save millions of people. 
399	So, let these decisions be taken. 
400	Let this flag stay with you, ladies and gentlemen. 
401	This flag is a symbol of our victory in this war. 
402	We stand, we fight and we will win because we are united — Ukraine, America and the entire free world.Just one thing, if I can, the last thing — thank you so much, may God protect our brave troops and citizens, may God forever bless the United States of America. 
403	Merry Christmas and a happy, victorious New Year. 
404	Slava Ukraini. 
405	[Glory to Ukraine.]
406	We all dream about it, don’t we? 
407	That fanciful notion of being so outrageously wealthy that we can buy whatever we want? 
408	It’s a fleeting thought, an unattainable fantasy for almost everyone. 
409	Not for Steven A. Cohen. 
410	Cohen’s net worth, according to Forbes, is $17.5 billion. 
411	He is not exactly relatable. 
412	But at some point in his life, Cohen decided he wanted to own his favorite baseball team and buy all the best players. 
413	If you’ve ever been a fan — if you’ve felt that fierce pride or anguish for something out of your control — you understand the impulse. 
414	The Mets won the World Series when Cohen was 13 years old, in 1969, and again when he was 30, in 1986. 
415	Now he is 66, with a fortune built in hedge funds that allowed him to purchase the Mets in 2020 for almost $2.5 billion. 
416	He has not yet bought a World Series ring, but he sure keeps trying.The latest star to benefit is Carlos Correa, who agreed to a 12-year, $315 million deal with the Mets  early Wednesday morning. 
417	The San Francisco Giants, who had a 13-year, $350 million agreement with Correa, hesitated after a medical review. 
418	That gave Cohen an opening to re-engage Correa’s agent, Scott Boras, and finish off their prior contract talks. 
419	The Correa agreement gives the Mets a 40-man payroll of $384.3 million, as projected by Cot’s Baseball Contracts. 
420	Add a projected tax of $111.5 million, and Cohen will spend almost $500 million for the 2023 payroll.Is it gluttonous? 
421	Of course it is. 
422	But as Ferris Bueller said about his buddy’s father’s Ferrari, “It is so choice. If you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up.” 
423	Cohen has the means. 
424	What’s another luxury item in a glitzy showroom?
425	Think of the Mets’ week so far. 
426	On Monday at Citi Field, they introduced Kodai Senga, the best free-agent pitcher on the international market. 
427	On Tuesday, they welcomed Justin Verlander , one of two active pitchers with 200 wins and 3,000 strikeouts. 
428	The other, Max Scherzer, signed with Cohen last December.Verlander will make $86.66 million for the next two seasons, the same as Scherzer. 
429	No player has ever had a higher salary. 
430	It is hard to upgrade over Jacob deGrom, who left the Mets for Texas  in free agency — but with Verlander, the Mets did it.Verlander was the Game 1 playoff starter for the Houston Astros, who won the World Series last month. 
431	The Mets have also signed José Quintana , the Game 1 playoff starter for the St. Louis Cardinals, who won the National League Central Division. 
432	They signed a setup man, David Robertson, from the N.L. champion Philadelphia Phillies.They also retained their All-Star closer, Edwin Díaz, for five years and $102 million , a record for a reliever, and kept center fielder Brandon Nimmo for eight years and $162 million. 
433	Nimmo plays between two free-agent additions from last winter, Mark Canha in left and Starling Marte in right. 
434	Both have thrived as Mets. 
435	In Correa, 28, the Mets add a smooth infielder with charisma and a big-game pedigree who hits for average and power. 
436	After seven stellar years with Houston and another with Minnesota, Correa was waiting for an owner like Cohen.
437	“When I go to the mall and I go to the Dior store and I want something, I get it,” Correa told Fox 9 in Minneapolis in late September. 
438	“I ask how much it costs and I buy it. So if you really want something, you just go get it. I’m the product here, and if they want my product, they’ve just got to come get it.” 
439	In New York, the product will change its factory setting. 
440	Correa has never played a defensive position besides shortstop, but he will switch to third to accommodate Francisco Lindor, the Mets’ incumbent at short. 
441	The two were teammates for Puerto Rico in the World Baseball Classic in 2017 and will share the left side of the Mets’ infield into the 2030s. 
442	Lindor, 29, has nine years remaining on his 10-year, $341 million contract.The Giants, who called off an introductory news conference with Correa already in town, have now tried and failed to sign both Correa and Aaron Judge, who returned to the Yankees for nine years and $360 million and was named captain  on Wednesday. 
443	The Giants did not disclose the medical issue that scuttled their Correa deal. 
444	“This is a delicate time and a delicate topic,” said the Giants’ chairman, Greg Johnson, when reached by phone on Wednesday morning. 
445	Johnson cited “a difference of opinion” with Correa and Boras and referred to a team statement that wished Correa well. 
446	In snagging Correa from a rival and moving him to third base, the Mets’ deal echoes the Yankees’ trade for Alex Rodriguez in 2004. 
447	The Rangers had tried to ship Rodriguez to the Boston Red Sox that off-season, but when the union rejected the deal (because of Rodriguez’s planned contract deferrals), the Yankees moved in for the kill. 
448	It played out pretty well: While Rodriguez and Derek Jeter had a somewhat uneasy friendship, they helped each other win. 
449	Jeter stayed at short, Rodriguez moved to third, and in a decade together, they reached the playoffs eight times and earned a championship in 2009. 
450	Every year Jeter and Rodriguez were teammates, the Yankees had the majors’ highest payroll. 
451	The Mets, quite clearly, are prepared to do the same for the era of Lindor and Correa. 
452	It is Cohen’s joyride, after all, and he has the means.
453	WASHINGTON — President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine delivered an emotional wartime appeal to a joint meeting of Congress on Wednesday night, telling Americans that “your money is not charity” and vowing that his people would eventually secure an improbable victory against Russia on behalf of all free nations. 
454	“Against all odds and doom-and-gloom scenarios, Ukraine did not fall,” Mr. Zelensky said in halting but forceful English from the dais in the House chamber, where he was greeted with extended applause from lawmakers.
455	“Ukraine is alive and kicking,” he said. 
456	“And it gives me good reason to share with you our first joint victory: We defeated Russia in the battle for minds of the world.” 
457	In blunt terms, Mr. Zelensky pleaded for more military assistance from the lawmakers, who are poised to approve $45 billion in additional aid by the end of the week, bringing the total over a year to nearly $100 billion. 
458	His message: Your support has kept President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia from overrunning our country. 
459	Now keep it coming. 
460	“We have artillery, yes, thank you,” he said. 
461	“We have it. Is it enough? Honestly, not really.” 
462	The money, he added, was not charity. 
463	“It’s an investment,” he said. 
464	Mr. Zelensky’s visit to Washington — kept secret until the eve of his arrival for security reasons — was a dramatic show of confidence by Ukraine’s leader, who had not left his country since Mr. Putin began his assault 300 days ago. 
465	In the space of 24 hours, just days before Christmas, Mr. Zelensky flew from the battered front lines of a country plunged into darkness by Russian air attacks to the marble-lined rooms of the White House and the Capitol, where he repeatedly thanked Americans for being partners in Ukraine’s battle to survive. 
466	Dressed in his wartime uniform of an olive green sweater and cargo pants, Mr. Zelensky began his speech by insisting that the lengthy standing ovation was “too much for me.” 
467	He ended it just over 20 minutes later by delivering a blue and gold Ukrainian battle flag to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who in return handed him a framed American flag that had flown over the Capitol earlier in the day in honor of his visit. 
468	The American flag in his right hand, Mr. Zelensky jabbed his left fist into the air triumphantly.
469	“We stand we fight and we will win because we are united — Ukraine, America and the entire free world,” he said. 
470	“May God protect our brave troops and citizens. May God forever bless the United States of America. Merry Christmas and a happy, victorious New Year.” 
471	His speech at the Capitol capped a remarkable day of urgent, personal diplomacy that began with more than two hours of closed-door meetings with President Biden at the White House, where both men reaffirmed their determination to defend Ukraine against Russian forces, who invaded in February. 
472	Standing side by side in the East Room with Ukraine’s flag hanging next to gleaming Christmas decorations, Mr. Biden and Mr. Zelensky faced reporters and pledged to continue fighting Russia’s invasion to force an end to Mr. Putin’s unwarranted aggression. 
473	Mr. Zelensky warned that his country was digging in for a long, cold winter of war and had little hope of securing a just peace with the “terrorists” who are battering his people. 
474	“The longer the war lasts, the longer this aggression lasts, there will be more parents who live for the sake of vengeance, or revenge,” Mr. Zelensky said through an interpreter, standing at a podium next to Mr. Biden. 
475	“So there can’t be any just peace in the war that was imposed on us,” he added.Mr. 
476	Biden pledged a united front with Mr. Zelensky, promising that “we will stay with you for as long as it takes.” “The American people know that if we stand by in the face of such blatant attacks on liberty and democracy, and the core principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, the world would surely face worse consequences,” Mr. Biden said.But both leaders sounded grim about the prospects for an end to the conflict any time soon. 
477	Mr. Biden said it was critical to “stand together through 2023,” suggesting another year of war in the heart of Europe. 
478	Mr. Zelensky offered a dire assessment of the months ahead: “We need to survive this winter,” he said. 
479	“We need to protect our people.” 
480	Mr. Zelensky is certain to get some, but not all, of what he wants before he heads home, barely 10 hours after arriving in Washington. 
481	Mr. Biden on Wednesday announced delivery of a Patriot missile battery to help Ukraine defend against attacks from the sky, but the administration is still refusing longer-range weapons that could strike deep into Russia and potentially draw the United States into direct conflict with Mr. Putin and his military. 
482	Mr. Zelensky’s outstretched hand has rankled some Biden administration officials at times during the past year. 
483	Wednesday’s appearance at the White House offered a glimpse of the transactional nature of the relationship between the two men as Mr. Zelensky acknowledged what he would do after receiving a Patriot missile battery from the United States to help defend Ukraine from air attacks. 
484	“After that we will send another signal to President Biden that we would like to get more Patriots,” he said, to scattered laughter in the room. 
485	The aside underscored both the human dynamic at play between the two men and Mr. Biden’s fears that providing too much military assistance, too quickly, could unleash a broader conflict with Russia and the West that would have even more dangerous consequences. 
486	Later, when a reporter from Ukraine asked Mr. Biden why he didn’t just give Mr. Zelensky all the weapons he wanted, Mr. Biden quipped: “His answer is yes,” pointing at the Ukrainian president. 
487	“I agree!” 
488	Mr. Zelensky responded quickly in English, prompting laughter from the audience. 
489	The visit to the White House comes as both sides gird for months of continued fighting. 
490	In Russia, officials warned that deliveries of new U.S. weapons would lead “to an aggravation of the conflict,” and Mr. Putin vowed that his government would provide “everything that the army asks for — everything” in its search for conquest.
491	“President Zelensky’s visit here is at least partially, maybe primarily, designed to bolster that support and rejuvenate the enthusiasm for Ukraine’s success,” said William B. Taylor Jr., who served as ambassador to Ukraine from 2006 to 2009. 
492	“That is all going to be necessary for the Ukrainians to be able to pre-empt a Russian offensive.” “The timing is perfect,” he said. 
493	For Mr. Biden, the highly orchestrated visit is an opportunity to remind Americans why he has committed the United States’ Treasury — though not its soldiers — to defending the borders of a country a continent away. 
494	It is critical, he argues, to stand up for the rights of sovereign nations when international law is violated. 
495	That decision has not come without sacrifices and political cost for Mr. Biden, who rightly predicted before the war started that Americans would suffer economic consequences as the ramifications of the first war in Europe in decades rippled across the world. 
496	Gas and food prices spiked, helping to send inflation soaring in the United States and elsewhere. 
497	Now, after rallying dozens of nations to oppose Russia’s invasion, Mr. Biden finds himself needing to hold that coalition together for longer than anyone inside the White House imagined at the start of the war. 
498	And he faces a concerted effort by Mr. Putin to break the alliance by restricting energy resources and attacking civilian areas in Ukraine.
499	“The most important part of this visit might be to combat Putin’s belief that time is on his side in the war,” said Richard Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations. 
500	“Putin can’t win in the battlefield so what he’s trying to do is break the will of the Ukrainian people by his attacks on civilian areas, and he’s trying to break Europe’s will by energy denial.” 
501	Ahead of their meeting on Wednesday, Mr. Zelensky presented Mr. Biden with a cross for military merit, an award that he said was given to him by a soldier on the front lines in Ukraine. 
502	The soldier, a captain, said Mr. Zelensky should give it to the “very brave president” who had saved many lives in their country. 
503	“Undeserved, but much appreciated,” Mr. Biden replied in a moment that underscored how the two leaders are intertwined in the ongoing conflict. 
504	But Mr. Biden and Mr. Zelensky must continue to build support among American voters and lawmakers, some of whom have begun to have doubts about the wisdom of an open-ended commitment to a conflict that shows no signs of ending. 
505	There remains widespread bipartisan support on Capitol Hill for financially supporting Ukraine in its war against Russia, and the majority of Republicans have rallied behind the aid. 
506	Some in the party have, however, pushed for greater oversight of the money being sent to Ukraine and others have questioned how much the country really needs. 
507	Some Republican lawmakers in Congress have indicated that they will vote later this week against a $1.7 trillion government spending bill that includes the money for Ukraine. 
508	After deadlocking over a pandemic immigration rule, the Senate adjourned on Wednesday night without voting on the bill.Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican leader in the House, told reporters recently that “I’m not for a blank check for anything. This is hardworking taxpayer money. And I want to make sure whatever funding we spend goes to the right places.” 
509	Still, during Wednesday night’s speech, Mr. McCarthy applauded for Mr. Zelensky. 
510	There is growing evidence that Americans in both parties are weary of the ongoing conflict. 
511	Some Democrats have been hearing from constituents who question the routine infusions of aid and are pressing Biden administration officials to say how they think the conflict will end — and when. 
512	During his remarks, Mr. Zelensky portrayed the war gripping his country in stark terms. 
513	He evoked World War II, and U.S. Army forces holding back Hitler’s forces in the Battle of the Bulge during Christmas 1944. 
514	Ukraine, he said, is doing the same in Christmas 2022, holding back Putin’s forces, which have been targeting civilian infrastructure with missiles and Iranian drones. 
515	“In two days we will celebrate Christmas, maybe candlelit, not because it’s more romantic, no, but because there will be no electricity,” he said, describing his people as too proud to complain about their situation. 
516	He compared Ukraine’s current war to America’s war of independence. 
517	“We Ukrainians will also go through our war of independence and freedom with dignity and success,” he said, prompting a roar of applause from the lawmakers.Reporting was contributed by Emily Cochrane in Washington, Anton Troianovski in Berlin and Andrew E. Kramer  in Kyiv.
518	The International African American Museum in Charleston, S.C., has building issues that will delay the eagerly awaited center’s opening until later in 2023, museum leaders said. 
519	Last week, the leaders said that the January opening was postponed because of faulty humidity and temperature controls required to protect its exhibits and artifacts, which tell the stories of the passage of thousands of enslaved Africans to the United States. 
520	The International African American Museum is at the former Gadsden Wharf, once a large port where nearly half of all enslaved Africans arrived; remnants of the wooden wharf were found by archaeologists in 2014 during an exploratory dig for the museum site.
521	“We regret this turn of events and any inconvenience to our loyal members,” Tonya M. Matthews, the museum’s president and chief executive, said in a Dec. 16 letter to donors. 
522	“We foreground the responsibility to ensure the highest standard of safety and preservation for our most sensitive objects, art and artifacts that honor the journey of our ancestors and tell the critical stories of our nation’s history.” 
523	Officials had planned the museum’s opening for the weekend of Jan. 21, after Martin Luther King’s Birthday; however, they now expect the inauguration ceremony to occur sometime within the first six months of next year.The delay was the latest in a series of postponements that have bedeviled the museum since the $120 million project was first proposed more than 20 years ago. 
524	The architect Henry N. Cobb worked with the landscape designer Walter Hood and the exhibitions designer Ralph Applebaum  to fill the 100,000-square-foot space with nine galleries; a genealogy center for visitors researching their own ancestries; and a memorial garden with a tidal pool.Matthews arrived at the museum last year amid a period of churn, which a former museum executive described in a memo to  trustees, obtained by The Post and Courier, as a result of a “toxic” and “siloed” work environment.  
525	However, the center has continued to grow to meet demands of the project and now has more than 30 employees. 
526	There had been recent signs of trouble with finishing the museum. 
527	In April, leaders asked the City of Charleston for an extra few million dollars to account for unforeseen challenges in finishing the center. 
528	Officials blamed supply chain issues and other construction costs like roof repairs, design changes and extra insurance.
529	“We broke ground in the fall of 2019, and then we hit the very trying period of Covid-19,” Matthews said in an interview Wednesday. 
530	“We were a bit hampered, but we did continue to plow through.”During an interview with a local news channel Monday, the museum’s chairman, Wilbur Johnson, said the board knew of the climate issues inside the building for a while and had been working to solve them. 
531	They were “not yet fully resolved” and he added that he considered the institution’s role in telling history to be “a sacred obligation.”Matthews said that museum officials are using the delay to refine a special exhibition, which has not been announced. 
532	The museum is also waiting for some artworks to complete its program, which has a permanent collection of nearly 300 works of art and historical artifacts telling the story of African Americans. 
533	This includes pottery by the enslaved artist David Drake, images from the Malian photographer Seydou Keita and an original copy of “Things Fall Apart,” the 1958 novel by Chinua Achebe. 
534	Visitors will also encounter “Seeking,” a short video by the filmmaker Julie Dash  that uses the coming-of-age traditions of the Gullah Geechee, descendants of West Africans brought to the American Southeastern coast, to describe a narrative of resilience.
535	“I was as excited about this opening as everyone else,” Matthews said. 
536	“I am an overachiever and I am ambitious. I honor and respect things like deadlines, but this is a huge responsibility and we will do what we need to make sure that we present this museum and the stories we tell in an extraordinary light.”
537	Adair, Iowa, is known locally as “the happiest town on Earth” for its smiley-face water tower , which welcomes visitors along Interstate 80. 
538	The former railroad town of about 800 people has several churches, small businesses, a volunteer fire department and a police department of two officers. 
539	So as Bradley Wendt, the town’s police chief, repeatedly purchased machine guns over the course of four years, purportedly for official use, federal investigators took note. 
540	Between 2018 and 2022, Mr. Wendt requested 90 machine guns, either to demonstrate their use or to buy them for the Adair Police Department, according to the Justice Department. 
541	But prosecutors concluded that he had other purposes in mind. 
542	On Dec. 14, a grand jury in Des Moines indicted Mr. Wendt and a friend, Robert Williams, on charges of conspiracy to make false statements and defraud the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. 
543	Mr. Wendt was also charged with illegal possession of a machine gun. 
544	According to the indictment, Mr. Wendt, 46, used his title as police chief to “obtain and possess machine guns not lawfully available to the public,” including military-grade weapons and machine guns of a type used in guarding high-risk prisoners as they are moved from place to place. 
545	A lawyer for Mr. Wendt did not return a request for comment. 
546	Clint Fitcher, a lawyer for the city of Adair, said that Mr. Wendt had not used the local government’s money to buy the machine guns and that Mr. Wendt had been placed on leave. 
547	He said some members of the Adair City Council were aware that Mr. Wendt had bought 10 machine guns for the department and that six of those guns had been found at City Hall during a raid in September. 
548	Mr. Fitcher said that he wasn’t sure where the funds for the guns had come from.Federal officials said Mr. Wendt had used what are known as law letters to the A.T.F. in which he falsely stated that the machine guns were being purchased for official use or were being used for demonstration on behalf of the Adair Police Department to “evaluate them for potential future purchase.” 
549	The A.T.F. administers and enforces federal machine gun laws. 
550	Any purchase, sale, transfer or importation of a machine gun must be approved by the agency, and requires law enforcement officials who are seeking to acquire them must generally submit a letter explaining why. 
551	Some licensed dealers may also buy machine guns for demonstration purposes, as long as they have a letter of request from a law enforcement agency. 
552	In all, Mr. Wendt bought 10 machine guns for the police department, tried to buy 15 additional guns and requested the demonstration of 65 guns, according to the indictment. 
553	But in reality, he sold six machine guns registered to the Adair Police Department for personal profit, making thousands of dollars; rented out machine guns in exchange for money; and intended to stockpile guns to sell at a later date, the indictment said.
554	“In fact, the Adair Police Department was not interested in and was not considering purchasing the machine guns identified in the demonstration law letters,” the indictment said. 
555	“Rather, the true purpose of the demonstration law letters was for Wendt to acquire machine guns for his personal use, enjoyment, profit and gain.” 
556	According to a Justice Department news release, Mr. Wendt also “exploited his position” as police chief to obtain 10 machine guns for Williams Contracting L.L.C., a federally licensed firearms dealer operated by Mr. Williams. 
557	Mr. Williams solicited the necessary law letters from Mr. Wendt, who falsely stated in the letters that the Adair Police Department wanted a demonstration of machine guns for potential future purchase, according to court documents. 
558	Mr. Williams was also accused of intending to stockpile the guns and sell them for a profit. 
559	In one instance, Mr. Wendt, using his own money, bought three machine guns for $2,080 each in December 2020 under the guise of official duties. 
560	Eight months later, Mr. Wendt sold two of them to a Florida-based buyer for $50,000. 
561	Many of the guns were not meant for use by the public.According to the indictment, Mr. Wendt contacted a machine gun manufacturer in January 2021 and inquired about buying a weapon known as a minigun, which prosecutors described as “an electric motor driven Gatling gun designed for speed and accuracy” that has a magazine capacity of 4,000 rounds and a fixed firing rate of 50 rounds per second. 
562	This type of machine gun is used by the U.S. military and is typically mounted on helicopters; the Adair Police Department does not own a helicopter. 
563	Mr. Wendt put down a $40,000 deposit for the $80,000 gun. 
564	In his law letter, Mr. Wendt said the gun was “suitable for engagements and suppressive fire.”The A.T.F. rejected the purchase because the minigun was “not suitable for law enforcement use.” 
565	And yet, making the machine guns available to the public was exactly what Mr. Wendt and Mr. Williams did, officials said. 
566	In April 2022, Mr. Wendt and Mr. Williams hosted a public machine gun shooting event in Woodbine, Iowa, allowing patrons to fire a number of the machine guns in exchange for money. 
567	Among the guns was a .50-caliber belt-fed machine gun that Mr. Wendt had claimed was needed for demonstration to the police department. 
568	In his law letter, Mr. Wendt said the gun was “ideal” for the department “based on its price and availability.” 
569	Mr. Wendt paid $17,896 for the gun. 
570	He mounted it to his armored Humvee and charged participants $5 per round.
571	Good morning. 
572	It’s Thursday. 
573	We’ll find out why the State Senate and the Assembly will convene today in an unusual special session. 
574	We’ll also look at why some New Yorkers say race shapes the criticism of Mayor Eric Adams.State lawmakers are gathering in Albany today to give themselves a raise. 
575	If only a salary bump were that easy for everyone. 
576	The bill before the lawmakers, who already get six-figure base salaries for a five-month scheduled session in Albany, would boost their pay to roughly twice the median family income in the United States  and slightly more than five times what lawmakers in neighboring Connecticut make. 
577	I asked my colleague Jesse McKinley for details.How are lawmakers in New York paid in comparison with other state legislators?
578	Pretty darn well. 
579	According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, New York lawmakers rank No. 2 in the nation in base pay , thanks to a raise they received in 2018. 
580	California, which has a habit of besting New York in all kinds of categories (population, economic output, number of professional baseball teams) is No. 1 for the moment.Won’t this make lawmakers in New York the best-compensated in the nation? 
581	Yes, with Thursday’s anticipated pay hike, Albany’s 213 lawmakers will now have the highest base salary of any in the country: $142,000 a year, from the current $110,000 a year. 
582	State lawmakers in California will still be taking home $119,702 a year.What’s the catch? 
583	The concession made by lawmakers to get that $32,000 raise is that they will agree to a $35,000 cap on outside income, something that good government groups have long pushed for (though some would like an even lower threshold for such nongovernment earning). 
584	The concern is the potential for corruption and conflicts of interest that could arise from, say, working in a law firm. 
585	Legislative leaders say this is a big step toward wiping out Albany’s well-deserved reputation for money-driven malfeasance. 
586	But the $35,000 limit won’t take effect until 2025, unlike the raise, which will take effect on Jan. 1.Why did they go back to Albany for one day just to give themselves a raise? 
587	Albany loves leaving things till the last minute, including its budgets, which used to be chronically late and now are only periodically late. 
588	The more germane answer, however, is that the bill authorizing the raise has to be approved before the new session of the Legislature begins in January. 
589	Lawmakers cannot vote themselves a raise that takes effect during the same session as the vote. 
590	It says so in the state Constitution. 
591	Obviously time is running out between now and January — hence, a lot of people descending on the capital for a one-day-only session.Will Gov. Kathy Hochul sign the bill raising their compensation? 
592	What happens if she decides not to sign it? 
593	The governor hasn’t explicitly said she’ll sign the bill to hike the lawmakers’ pay, but she’s expressed support for such an increase in the past. 
594	Also, it seems unlikely to me that the legislators would go all the way back to Albany without an implicit understanding that Hochul — a Democrat, like the leaders that control both houses of the Legislature — is cool with higher salaries. 
595	If she decided not to sign the bill, my best guess is that she would get very few Christmas presents from legislative leaders this year.What has the reaction been? 
596	Giving yourself a raise is always a bad look for politicians, even if many outside groups agree that it’s not unjustified. 
597	Republicans have lambasted the raise — and its timing during a “special session” — and some watchdog groups have said it doesn’t go far enough to limit outside earning.But legislative leaders stand by it, including the speaker of the Assembly, Carl Heastie. 
598	“I don’t think there’s enough money in the world,” he said recently, “that could compensate you for being away from your families.”Weather Prepare for wind gusts and rain persisting through the evening.

Mays and Emma G. Fitzsimmons write that several Black leaders are raising concerns that criticism of the mayor has been shaped by race . 
606	They suggest that implicit racism undermined Mayor David Dinkins, the city’s first Black mayor, a generation ago, and could undercut Adams now.Adams himself said that he was accustomed to criticism, but that when some people “look at these two Black mayors, Dinkins and my role now, there are those that wish we fail.”“Look at all the mayors,” he said. 
607	“Dinkins and I are the only two mayors that people talk about how we went out at night. They used to say he had a tuxedo in his car all the time because he went out to different galas and balls and what have you. That’s the role of the mayor.”Adams’s allies may be hoping to discourage criticism at a time when his popularity appears to be waning: In a recent Siena College poll , 50 percent of voters in the city viewed him favorably and 35 percent unfavorably.Adams, a former police captain, has sought to have a better relationship with the police than Dinkins did: He brought back a controversial plainclothes police unit . 
608	He has also dispatched waves of officers to address crime on the subway and protected police funding in his budget while often standing by officers accused of misconduct.Adams said he had drawn two lessons from Dinkins’s loss to Rudolph Giuliani in 1993: Focus on making “real changes in office” and do not allow your political coalition to erode.

632	After years of interruptions from extreme summer heat, the New York City Triathlon will move to the fall, with a race date of Oct. 1. 
633	The change comes after what has been a rough few years for the race, which is a 1,500-meter swim in the Hudson River, a 40-kilometer bike ride through Manhattan and the Bronx, and a 10-kilometer run ending in Central Park. 
634	The event, which hosted 1,600 participants on a shortened course this summer, has not been held in its entirety for years because of heat waves and concerns around safety in the Hudson.In 2018, while the event was already in progress, organizers shortened the run portion of the event to one mile as temperatures climbed to a high of 96 degrees. 
635	In 2019, at the urging of former Mayor Bill de Blasio, the race was canceled  as temperatures were expected to be as high as 98 degrees on race day.The race was not held in 2020 because of the pandemic, and in 2021, the swim portion of the race was canceled because of concerns about bacteria in the Hudson River. 
636	And once again, this year’s race was disrupted by a heat wave . 
637	The bike portion of the event was cut in half, and the run portion of the event was shortened to 4 kilometers. 
638	While triathletes have complained about the multiple interruptions, organizers have said the midsummer conditions were most favorable for both obtaining the necessary permits and navigating the river tides. 
639	But on Tuesday, the race, which was founded in 2001 and is put on by Life Time, announced it had moved the date to October. 
640	“Our goal is to avoid summer weather trends, which have negatively affected participants and spectators in past years, and improve the overall safety and the event experience for our incredible athletes,” the statement read. 
641	Many athletes were relieved to hear the news. 
642	That includes Pascal Lestable, a New Yorker who has competed in the event before, but has yet to compete in a full, uninterrupted race. 
643	“We’ll finally have a triathlon with all three disciplines without fearing any changes because of the weather,” Lestable said.Doc Golden, a triathlete who coaches for the Empire Tri Club, said the move was welcome, especially for athletes new to triathlons. 
644	New York City beaches aren’t open until Memorial Day, she said, and the move to October “creates new opportunities for new people to train smarter and longer.” 
645	Plus having less anxiety around weather-related hiccups doesn’t hurt either, she said.
646	“Physically and mentally, it’s better to do it in October.”As fossil-fuel emissions warm the planet, extreme heat is a growing danger for cities, including New York . 
647	On Oct. 1 this year, the high in New York City was 61 degrees. 
648	But a fall date doesn’t guarantee cool temperatures. 
649	On Nov. 6, temperatures reached a record 75 degrees during the New York City Marathon .

651	The same reason that before the final game, Qatar had hosted what was billed  as “the world’s biggest fashion show,” with looks by more than 150 different designers from 50 countries, all of it orchestrated by the former French Vogue editor Carine Roitfeld. 
652	When it comes to cultural influence, fashion and sports have increasingly teamed up to be the power forwards of the game. 
653	Both offer a shared language spoken across the world, communicated in an instant. 
654	And in 2022, the relationship reached a new level. 
655	One driven by the tangles of social media, the growth of influencer and sneaker culture and a pandemic-spurred shift in cultural consumption. 
656	Something more essential has been going on. 
657	When you start looking, the connections are everywhere, creating a new root system that’s shaping our sense of self.Just about a week before the World Cup began, for example, across the world in New York, the Knicks announced they had named Ronnie Feig, otherwise known as the co-founder of Kith, and a “legend of streetwear culture,” their first creative directorAnd just a few weeks before that, the Arizona Coyotes, the ice hockey team, announced that it had appointed Rhuigi Villaseñor, the founder of the Los Angeles men’s wear line Rhude, as its creative strategist — a job he got not long after he became the designer of Bally , the Swiss luxury brand.The news came in the wake of Serena Williams announcing that she was stepping back from tennis — and then stepping onto the runway as the opening model in the Vogue World show. 
658	Of Tom Brady introducing Brady, his brand of lifestyle casual wear created with Jens Grede (the man who is behind the Kim Kardashian Skims line) and designed by Dao-Yi Chow, formerly of the Public School label. 
659	Of Allyson Felix introducing her brand, Saysh. 
660	Of Ferrari holding its first fashion show on the official schedule at Milan Fashion WeekOf the Jordan brand choosing to open its first concept store in Milan, rather than, say, Chicago. 
661	As to why, well, “it’s a fashion capital of the world,” Craig Williams, the brand’s president, told WWD. 
662	“People come here because they are thinking about what’s new, what will be hot a year or two from now, And when we think about the impact we want to have with consumers, in the industry, in streetwear, and in culture too, there are a lot of synergies between our aspirations and everything Milan represents.”In Mr. Grede’s words: “It comes down to the intersection of commerce and entertainment. They have converged.”Mr. 
663	Villaseñor said his deal with the Coyotes will allow him to get his hands on everything from, potentially, “the campaigns to the color palette of the arena, the drinks, the lighting, the logo and the design, including outside the stereotypical merch program to dressing the team on both a street and formality level.” 
664	It’s like an in-house makeover program! 
665	And not unlike what he is trying to do in reinventing Bally, where he added some louche razzle-dazzle to the Alpine ephemera. 
666	“If you really dissect it, it’s about honoring the heritage and amplifying it,” Mr. Villaseñor said. 
667	That’s the sort of fashionspeak traditionally found in design ateliers, not weight rooms. 
668	But, said Scott Malkin, an owner of the New York Islanders, it’s not the only connection. 
669	Mr. Malkin is also the founder of Value Retail, a group of luxury outlet malls in Europe and Asia, and this year he broke ground on a new shopping village next to the recently opened UBS hockey arena in Belmont Park.Sports and fashion are both, he said, “about creative energy married to execution,” about managing talent that often doesn’t easily fit into a rigid structure and that has to evolve as society does. 
670	They both deal with a relentless schedule and can have enormous psychic impact and reach, he said, and both love to talk about the “curation of experience.” 
671	And they are both about branding, at the macro and micro level. 
672	What is a brand, after all, except a collection of values encompassed by a name or a logo or an object? 
673	It’s a symbol that represents, say, heritage, know-how, beauty. 
674	Or excellence, aspiration, power, grace and activism — all the adjectives that attach to athletes. 
675	And sometimes handbags. 
676	Or sneakers.
677	“People really care what a brand stands for,” said Tory Burch, who has merged her main line and sport line and who this year created the winner’s jacket for the Billie Jean King Cup. 
678	“And brands are very focused on building their communities.” 
679	One way to do this is through shared live experiences that generate deep emotional connections. 
680	Another way is through individuals who represent the citizenry of the brand. 
681	It’s a virtuous circle of group identification, flying the flags of their allegiance. 
682	Only they aren’t flags — they’re clothes.This is how the whole concept of the so-called brand ambassador began: The celebrity became the personification of the brand, a shortcut to knowing what it stood for, because, as Mr. Grede said of Brady, you knew what the person stood for. 
683	(Or thought you did; sometimes, as with Kanye West, there are surprises.) 
684	But while the idea may have originated with traditional Hollywood stars and starlets, it has now fully moved into sports. 
685	From basketball and tennis to soccer, football and even baseball — think of Joc Pederson (currently with the San Francisco Giants) and his pearls — and ice hockey. 
686	“Anyone who understands who they are and what they are showing the world at a deep level attracts influence,” said Jerry Lorenzo, the founder of Fear of God, who this year expanded to Fear of God Athletics, a performance lifestyle line made in conjunction with Adidas, which will be introduced in 2023. 
687	And influence sells product. 
688	Sports stars have long understood the role of image making in extending and ameliorating fame, ever since René Lacoste put a little alligator on his the left breast of his polo shirt and Stan Smith put his name on some kicks. 
689	Athletes like Joe Namath with his furs exploited the potential of camera appeal for burnishing an on-field reputation in the television age.But, said Mark Shapiro, the president of Endeavor — which owns multiple fashion weeks around the world and the Ultimate Fighting Championship as well as modeling and sports representation arms — it was really “Michael Jordan who changed it all when he started coming to press conferences fully decked out in a custom-made suit and tie.”Even before Mr. Jordan started his line with Nike, he understood the leverage that dressing to complement his play could provide, and he created a model that has been emulated by David Beckham, Odell Beckham Jr., Venus Williams, Russell Westbrook, Roger Federer and Naomi Osaka, to name a few. 
690	As Tom Brady said in an email, “he paved the way for most of us.” 
691	In the same way that Hollywood stars realized that red carpet appearances could be as much a performance and form of outreach as any actual performance, athletes realized that by branding themselves through what they wore, they extended their performance beyond the action and, Mr. Shapiro said, “opened the door to the next step in their career.” 
692	They gave themselves a profile independent of their platform.That led to draft days that function like runway shows, with neophyte athletes using their moment in the spotlight to brand themselves even before they join a team. 
693	The walk from car to changing room on game day was transformed into a daily photo op, which gave rise to such Instagram accounts as LeagueFits, BlitzFits and SlamKicks , which track athletes’ fashion choices.
694	“In the era of social media, when Instagram moves product and the camera is always on, the legend gets made on the field,” Mr. Shapiro said. 
695	“But every other waking moment is an image-making performance about what you are wearing, the products you use and how that gets shared.”While the rise of social media has circumvented the old power structures of fame, allowing direct communication between stars (and those who would be stars) and fans, it has also led to audience fragmentation. 
696	As Ben Affleck said at The New York Times DealBook  conference, speaking about his new production company, Artists Equity, created with Matt Damon, the reason there aren’t mega-movie stars any more isn’t because actors are less charismatic or less talented but because the viewing public has been niche-ified, divided into evermore specific interest groups.Mr. 
697	Grede agreed. 
698	Celebrity, which can now be achieved purely through social media, “may be the only unfair advantage in consumer culture,” he said. 
699	“Skims benefited from that, and so does Brady. He is an enterprise the same way Kim Kardashian is an enterprise.” 
700	Mr. Brady currently has 13 million Instagram followers; Mr. Beckham, 76.4 million; Ms. Williams, 16 million. 
701	“People, especially young people, find inspiration more broadly and more readily in their sports heroes and their fashion brands than they do in other industries,” Mr. Malkin said. 
702	And both sides want to profit. 
703	“Individuals are now intellectual property,” Gerry Cardinale, a backer of Artist’s Equity, said at the DealBook conference. 
704	It is probably not a coincidence that the first film from their production company will focus on is the birth of the Air Jordan brand. 
705	Mr. Grede said the direct-to-consumer model has forever shifted the landscape in terms of individual opportunity. 
706	Previously, an athlete or celebrity was dependent on one of the handful of sports clothing mega-brands to distribute their lines. 
707	Not any more. 
708	Now they can profit from their own brand equity, rather than lend it to another brand, be it Nike or Dior. 
709	At the same time, “teams are wising up to the idea the brand is also the star,” Mr. Grede said. 
710	“And the team is a lifestyle brand.” “Lifestyle” being the operative word. 
711	It’s why Mr. Malkin created Isles Lab, a store featuring luxury hockey merch masterminded by a team with roots in brands like Burberry that, he said, sells a $995 cashmere Islanders blanket and a $2,500 varsity jacket, among other things. 
712	Teams come with a ready-made fan base — the community that all brands want — and any community gravitates toward advertising its identity and membership via merch. 
713	And there is no reason that merch has to be a generic screen-printed logo T-shirt in a thin fabric. 
714	Indeed, tickets to big games are so expensive — sitting courtside has become such a luxury signifier — that it is striking that the clothing that symbolizes allegiance hasn’t kept up. 
715	Which is where designers come in. 
716	That’s why, said Clara Wu Tsai, an owner of the Brooklyn Nets and New York Liberty, who attended Mr. Villaseñor’s Bally debut, odds are good that his appointment at the Coyotes and Mr. Feig’s at the Knicks will become a trend, not an oddity. 
717	And if teams and athletes are looking to luxury as a strategic model, then it is only a matter of time before luxury starts looking at teams and extending their brands into the sports arena in a more entrenched way. 
718	Not just as sponsors, but owners. 
719	Indeed, this year rumors were rife that LVMH was interested in buying AC Milan. 
720	LVMH denied it , but you can understand where the idea came from. 
721	Just consider the synergies: LVMH could situate one of its luxury hotels, filled with its products, next to a stadium; its designers could create special collaborations just for the team; the designers could fill their front rows and marketing campaigns with LVMH athletes. 
722	“Absolutely, they could own a franchise,” Mr. Grede said. 
723	Which means in 2023 and beyond, the playing field could be irrevocably changed.
724	The first great crime novel of 2023 is BLAZE ME A SUN (Hogarth, 435 pp., $28) , by the decorated Swedish crime writer Christoffer Carlsson, who twines together national and personal traumas to devastating effect.The central crime — the murder of a young woman in Tiarp, a small Swedish town, mere hours after the assassination of the prime minister Olof Palme — is horrific. 
725	The perpetrator helpfully calls the police to tell them what he’s done, adding, “I’m going to do it again.”More killings follow, kindling deep anger in Sven Jörgensson, the first detective on the case. 
726	“When Sven closed his eyes, he saw the green fields and deep forests of Nyarasen, the car that had been left up in Tiarp and the violence that had befallen the woman in the back seat. Hardly a day went by that he didn’t do this — close his eyes and meander through these scenes he’d once experienced, perhaps in the hopes of noticing something he’d overlooked before.”“Blaze Me a Sun,” translated by Rachel Willson-Broyles, contains deep pleasures and thrilling surprises. 
727	What I most loved is how Carlsson plumbs what can and cannot be known about human lives and criminal investigations. 
728	He understands how familial love can blind people to difficult truths, and how “closure” often never happens. 
729	“I refuse to die,” the mother of one of the murdered women says. 
730	“I just don’t know how to keep on living.”A serial killer obsessed with redheads stalks the pages of Tracy Clark’s HIDE (Thomas & Mercer, 369 pp., paperback, $16.99) , engaging in ritual murder in downtown Chicago during broad daylight. 
731	“Hide” kicks off a series starring Detective Harriet Foster, who can tell it will be rough going as soon as she arrives at the first crime scene. 
732	Not only because of the killer’s apparent signature — lines of blood-red lipstick drawn around the victim’s wrists and ankles — but also because she’s still working through her own grief and guilt over the suicide of her longtime partner on the force.
733	“There had to have been signs. … But Foster had missed every single one, even though she had been trained to lock in, to be observant, intuitive even, to always see three moves ahead.”Unfortunately, Foster’s new partner is a jerk, needling her with boorish racist and sexist comments while failing to pull his investigative weight even as the deaths mount: “A by-the-book cop and  a bleeding heart? Boy, did I hit the jackpot,” he sneers at her early on. 
734	When Foster gets a tip to look into the behavior of an unstable young man with a violent past, she begins to sense just how deep the levels of depravity will run.Juniper Jessup, the narrator of Olivia Blacke’s new cozy mystery, VINYL RESTING PLACE (St. Martin’s, 304 pp., paperback, $8.99),  planned to make it far, far away from Cedar River, Texas, close enough to Austin for commuting but distant enough to retain serious small-town bona fides. 
735	Then, Juni’s sisters, Tansy and Maggie, implore her to return home to help out and sink cash into the family’s record shop and cafe, Sip & Spin. 
736	Since her life out West isn’t really clicking, Juni comes home, resigned to making a future in Texas. 
737	At least, until she finds a dead body in a supply closet during a party at the shop, and the main suspect is her Uncle Calvin, a practical joker and Sip & Spin’s silent partner, who becomes an apparent fugitive when he disappears after his arrest. 
738	Of course the Jessup sisters put their heads together and figure out who the real culprit is, even if baser instincts — and the presence of Juni’s police detective ex — suggest that’s less than a stellar idea. 
739	Blacke’s previous series, which was set in hipsterish Brooklyn, felt out of tune; the more relaxed vibe of “Vinyl Resting Place” is bolstered by the sisters’ genuine bond, colorful personalities and not-so-gentle conflicts. 
740	It’s a winning combination.If Gelett Burgess’s name is familiar to readers, it’s very likely because of his 1895 nonsense poem “The Purple Cow” (though his claim to fame should probably be that he  coined the word “blurb”).  
741	Beginning in 1908, Burgess, a poet and humorist, also published stories featuring Astro the Seer — a Sherlock Holmes knockoff in the guise of a mystic, clad in a turban and red silk robes — and his comely assistant, Valeska Wynne.These stories, which were first collected in book form in 1912, are now being reissued by the Library of Congress Crime Classics line as  THE MASTER OF MYSTERIES (Poisoned Pen Press, 496 pp., paperback $14.99).  
742	Several things emerge when reading through all 24 of these tales back-to-back, chiefly Burgess’ sense of the ridiculous. 
743	He hardly hides from the reader that Astro the Seer, whose real name is Astrogon Kerby, is a full-on charlatan, his public proclamations of clairvoyance a subterfuge for milking the rich of their money. 
744	Astro and Valeska are also superior detectives, uncovering mysteries major and minor among the moneyed classes. 
745	What’s hidden from them — but not the reader — is their growing attraction. 
746	The resolution is equal parts dated and sweet, but also earned.
747	JERUSALEM — Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, announced on Wednesday that he had succeeded in forming a coalition government that is set to bring him back to power at the helm of the most right-wing administration in Israeli history. 
748	Once finalized and ratified by Parliament in the coming days, the coalition deal will return Mr. Netanyahu to office just 18 months after he left it, amid concerns that his reliance on far-right factions will cause Israel to drift away from liberal democracy. 
749	Mr. Netanyahu will lead a hard-line six-party coalition whose members seek to upend the judicial system, reduce Palestinian autonomy in the occupied West Bank, further strengthen Israel’s Jewish character and maximize state support for the most religious Jews. 
750	After five elections through four years of political disruption, the deal is set to give Israel an ideologically cohesive government for the first time since 2019. 
751	But analysts say that will not necessarily provide political stability. 
752	Despite their relative homogeneity, the coalition’s members frequently disagreed over policy during negotiations and took more than six weeks to formalize their partnership.In a sign of the difficulties in reaching an agreement, Mr. Netanyahu announced the deal just minutes before a midnight deadline on Wednesday night. 
753	“I am informing you that I have been able to form a government that will act in the interest of all citizens of Israel,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a late-night phone call with Isaac Herzog, the country’s largely ceremonial president, according to a video  released by Mr. Netanyahu’s office. 
754	The coalition’s formation puts the country on course for a constitutional showdown between the government and the judiciary. 
755	The government will be led by a prime minister, Mr. Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption. 
756	Mr. Netanyahu denies any intention to use his office to influence the trial. 
757	But other members of his coalition have pledged to legalize some of the crimes of which he is accused and to reduce the influence of the attorney general, who oversees his prosecution.Last week, the attorney general, Gali Baharav-Miara, accused Mr. Netanyahu’s bloc of attempting to turn Israel into a “democracy in name, not in substance.” 
758	Her comments followed the coalition’s efforts to expand the government’s control over the police — and to allow Mr. Netanyahu’s pick for the interior ministry to take office despite a recent suspended prison sentence for tax fraud . 
759	Coalition lawmakers have also proposed curbing the influence of the Supreme Court, reducing judicial oversight over their decisions in Parliament and potentially making it easier for the government to enact laws that would previously have been considered unconstitutional. 
760	The Israeli right has long portrayed the Supreme Court as an unelected body that unfairly overrides elected governments, while the court’s supporters see it as a bulwark against the erosion of liberal democratic values and minority rights. 
761	Mr. Netanyahu has dismissed these concerns, promising to rein in his partners and take a cautious approach to judicial reform. 
762	He previously served as prime minister between 1996-1999 and 2009-2021, and has asked his critics to judge him on his prior record in office.
763	“I’m the opposite of a strongman — I believe in democracies and obviously in the balance between the three branches of government,” Mr. Netanyahu said in a recent interview  with Honestly, an American podcast.Mr. 
764	Netanyahu added: “That balance has in many ways been impaired in Israel by the rise of unchecked judicial power, and correcting it is not destroying democracy — it’s protecting it.” 
765	The relationship between the incoming government and the military will provide an early test of Mr. Netanyahu’s approach.Mr. 
766	Netanyahu has already agreed to give control over parts of the military bureaucracy and security forces in the West Bank to two far-right allies, prompting a rare public intervention by the military chief of staff amid fears that the move will fragment the army’s chain of command .
767	The announcement increases the likelihood of tensions between the government and large parts of the Jewish diaspora. 
768	Many liberal-leaning Jews outside of Israel have expressed wariness  in recent weeks about Mr. Netanyahu’s new partners. 
769	Several lawmakers in the new coalition have long criticized non-Orthodox movements in Judaism, to which the majority of American Jews adhere. 
770	Though Mr. Netanyahu’s party, Likud, is largely secular, the other parties in his coalition are all religious, and two of them represent ultra-Orthodox Jewish Israelis, or Haredim. 
771	Once kingmakers in both right-wing and left-wing coalition, ultra-Orthodox politicians have gradually become staunch supporters of Mr. Netanyahu, in return for his promising to uphold the autonomy of the Haredi school system and subsidies for its students. 
772	Future ministers in Mr. Netanyahu’s cabinet also include several far-right Jewish settlers who have a history of homophobia, antagonism toward Israel’s Arab minority and opposition to secular aspects of public life.One, Itamar Ben-Gvir , was barred from serving in the Israeli Army because he was considered too extremist. 
773	He admires a hard-line rabbi who wanted to strip Arab Israelis of their citizenship, and for years, he displayed a portrait in his home of an extremist Jewish settler who shot dead 29 Palestinians in 1994 in a mosque in the West Bank city of Hebron. 
774	Despite criminal convictions for incitement to racism and support for a terrorist group, Mr. Ben-Gvir is set to be minister for national security, overseeing the police.Another extremist in the alliance, Bezalel Smotrich , has previously expressed support for segregation of Jews and Arabs in Israeli maternity wards, for governing Israel according to the laws of the Torah and for Jewish property developers who won’t sell land to Arabs. 
775	Mr. Smotrich has been promised the finance ministry; his party will also oversee parts of the West Bank occupation. 
776	Their rise reflects a long-term rightward drift within Israel society, which began decades ago and accelerated after the second Palestinian intifada, or uprising, in the early 2000s. 
777	A surge of Palestinian violence at that time nudged many Israelis toward the right-wing argument that the Palestinians were not serious about making peace.The far right’s emergence also reflects more recent fears about perceived threats to Israel’s Jewish identity, which were exacerbated last year by a wave of violence  between Arabs and Jews.Those fears were also heightened when Mr. Netanyahu’s opponents formed a government in June last year with an independent Arab party, an unprecedented decision in Israeli history . 
778	That diverse alliance put aside their differences exclusively to force Mr. Netanyahu from power, causing him to leave office for the first time since 2009.But the departing coalition’s heterogeneity was also its downfall. 
779	Its inclusion of Arab lawmakers helped increase the popularity of Israel’s far right  and its lack of cohesion made it harder to govern, leading to a collapse over the summer. 
780	That set the stage for an election on Nov. 1, Israel’s fifth since 2019, and allowed Mr. Netanyahu’s right-wing bloc to win a narrow majority.Isabel Kershner  contributed reporting.
781	I wrote  in 2019 that Donald Trump ascended to folk hero status among the people who liked him, which meant that his lying, corruption, sexism and grift not only did not damage him, they added to his legend. 
782	The folk hero is transcendent. 
783	He defies convention and defies gravity — in Trump’s case, political and cultural gravity. 
784	He overcomes the impossible, wins the improbable, evades authority. 
785	He was a classic trickster figure, common in folklore. 
786	For instance, for a Black child growing up in the American South, Stack-O-Lee (or, among other variations, Stagger Lee, as we pronounced it) was a folk hero. 
787	“Stack” 
788	Lee Shelton was a Black man, a pimp, who in 1895 shot another man dead for snatching his hat. 
789	The story became the subject of so-called murder ballads. 
790	Shelton bolstered his legend when, after being released from prison, he killed another man during a robbery.This man, this figure, who negotiated the space between slavery and freedom, between criminal and hero, “came to personify the collective feeling of blacks at the bottom of society, and it was in this sense that Stagolee became a symbol of the Black community,” as Cecil Brown wrote in his book “Stagolee Shot Billy.”Writing in Mother Jones in 2011, Joe Kloc described how Stack-O-Lee became a hero in Southern Black society by unapologetically breaking its rules. 
791	The murders he committed “only serve to illustrate the injustices of southern society,” Kloc wrote. 
792	“For all the myth surrounding him, there is something very rational about Stack-O-Lee’s character: Why follow some of society’s rules when so many others work against you?” 
793	This is why I so instinctively understood Trump’s appeal and heroizing. 
794	Years, decades, of twisted propaganda had turned working-class white people into a victimized class. 
795	These white people saw themselves as the new Negro, in a turned-tables alternate reality. 
796	Society’s rules threatened to — or, had already begun to — work against them. 
797	Trump, the trickster and rule-breaker, emerges as an amalgamation of their anxieties and rebellion. 
798	He was a politician, but to them, above politics. 
799	The Donald was approaching deity. 
800	His followers embraced a cultish zealotry. 
801	But things have changed.Trump’s announcement of a third run for the White House landed with a thud. 
802	High-profile Republicans have refused to sign on as early endorsers. 
803	Trump himself is cloistered at Mar-a-Lago, having not held a single public campaign event since his announcement. 
804	In fact, he has been reduced to the low and laughable position of personally hawking digital trading cards of himself. 
805	(Trump has always seen his die-hard supporters as customers to whom he could sell a product, whether a candidacy or a card.)And a recent poll  showed that Republican and Republican-leaning voters, at least at this point, prefer Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida to Trump by double digits. 
806	So, what happened? 
807	In short, God bled. 
808	And once you see God bleed, you can no longer believe that someone is God. 
809	It is impossible to overstate how damaging the results of the midterms were, not just to Republicans, but to Trump himself. 
810	For years, Trump had been able to blame losses or defeats on other people, or even recast them as victories. 
811	Even though the Robert Mueller report was damning in many ways and went out of its way not to exonerate Trump, the fact that no charges were brought against Trump left him with the opening to claim total vindication. 
812	He wasn’t disgraced as much as a victim of a politically motivated plot. 
813	Impeachment, he told his supporters, driven by my political enemies, had twice failed to remove me. 
814	He wasn’t the most flawed president, but the most resilient.When Trump lost in 2020, he blamed corruption and a stolen election. 
815	That, of course, was another lie. 
816	According to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the 2020 election was “the most secure in American history,” and “there is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.” 
817	Nevertheless, Republican state legislatures across the country used Trump’s election fraud lie as a rationale to “fix” election systems that weren’t broken, to implement even more oppressive voting restrictions. 
818	But there was an unintended consequence: By boasting about making their electoral processes more secure, Republicans took away whatever latitude they had to lie about elections being stolen when they lost. 
819	And, in the midterms, they lost some major races, including in states that had implemented the most regressive voter laws, like Georgia and Arizona, where Democrats handily dispatched Trump’s anointed candidates. 
820	There was no way to wiggle out of the devastating truth of the cycle: The Trump brand was too tarnished and toxic to win in many battleground states. 
821	He was no longer able to defy political gravity. 
822	At the same time, Trump’s legal losses are mounting as multiple investigations close in on him. 
823	The man many had compared to Teflon is beginning to appear more like fly paper. 
824	Where some Republicans once saw invincibility, they now sense weakness and injury. 
825	And in the pack mentality of politics, this is the moment that they are most likely to turn on him.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

830	This poem aptly captures the complicated emotions of being human, and the way natural forces like an ocean’s waves can both mirror and erase emotions such as anger and sadness. 
831	The moment when “dootł’izh” appears complicates the poem in interesting ways; because the Navajo word can mean both green or blue, it is perhaps a metaphor for the mixture of elusive emotions that can coexist within humans. 
832	The chantlike ending relinquishes the thinking mind, allowing the language of the ocean to overtake everything.

836	Esther G. Belin  is a multimedia artist and writer. 
837	She is the author of ‘‘From the Belly of My Beauty’’ (University of Arizona Press, 1999), a book of poems; and co-editor of ‘‘The Diné Reader: An Anthology of Navajo Literature’’ (University of Arizona Press, 2021), both of which won the American Book Award from the Before Columbus Foundation. 
838	This poem appears in her most recent collection, ‘‘Of Cartography’’ (The University of Arizona Press, 2017).

840	On Dec. 7, Kathleen Glasgow added a happy note to the increasingly discordant chorus of Twitter. 
841	The author of four books for young adults tweeted, “OH MY GOD. #1. I don’t even know what to say so please enjoy my text to Child 1.”This dispatch was followed by 12 weeping emojis, a picture of the young adult best-seller list with Glasgow’s 2016 novel, “Girl in Pieces,” in the No. 1 slot, and a screenshot of texts to her 14-year-old son: “Mommy’s a #1 nyt best-selling author! Mommy might be crying a little. Also how was piano?”A few minutes later, Glasgow followed up with her son’s response: “AAAAY LES GO VERY NICE piano was fine.”In a phone interview, Glasgow, who is no stranger to the best-seller list, said that she owes the recent success of her six-year-old book to its popularity among teens on TikTok. 
842	“We were on lockdown for two years, basically, and a lot of kids were doing remote schooling and they spent time reading books and being online and lonely,” Glasgow said. 
843	“‘Girl in Pieces’ is about feeling alone in the world even if you’re with other people, and I think that got intensified during the pandemic for younger readers.” 
844	Glasgow’s 17-year-old protagonist battles with depression and the urge to self-harm, demons her creator also stared down as a teenager. 
845	“I gave Charlie Davis my own physical scars and my thoughts and feelings, but her story is fictional,” Glasgow said. 
846	She wasn’t planning to write about her struggles — “No one wants to hear that story” — until one day, in her late 20s, she was on a bus from St. Paul to Minneapolis, en route to the University of Minnesota, where she was the coordinator of the M.F.A. program in creative writing for 13 years.
847	“I sat next to a girl who was about 15 and had fresh scars on her arm,” Glasgow, now 53, recalled. 
848	“When she saw me looking, she pulled down her sleeve and got off at the next stop. I couldn’t stop thinking about her. I was the adult in that situation and I should have said, ‘You’re not alone. You can get through this.’”At the time, Glasgow was strictly a poet. 
849	But not long after this encounter, she said, “I started writing what I consider a 400-page letter to that girl and kids like her who are struggling with scars inside and out, who don’t feel seen and can’t verbalize what’s going on with them.” 
850	She added, “I didn’t have any expectations of being published; I just wanted to write a really good story about what it’s like to feel alone. And I did.”Elisabeth Egan is an editor at the Book Review and the author of “A Window Opens.”
851	The clearest signal that the U.S. economy is likely to fall into a recession in the next year is coming from interest rates. 
852	One of the first people to establish the signaling value of interest rates was Arturo Estrella, then an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
853	I interviewed him recently about his life, his research and what he foresees for the economy. 
854	Before I get to Estrella, though, here’s the chart that has a lot of economists, including him, deeply worried. 
855	It shows the path of yields this year on two Treasury securities, the three-month bill and the 10-year note. 
856	More than 90 percent of the time the yield on the shorter-term security is lower than the yield on the longer-term security. 
857	When the pattern flips, as it did this year, it’s a strong signal that a recession is nigh.Using monthly averages for the two securities, Estrella calculates that there’s about a 95 percent chance of a recession in the coming year. 
858	(Other economists analyze different pairs of securities, such as two-year versus 10-year notes, and consequently get slightly different results.) 
859	To see why Estrella is so certain, picture a narrow band where short- and long-term rates are roughly equal. 
860	Inside that band, it’s hard to say what will happen to the economy. 
861	But things are much clearer when there’s a noticeable gap between short- and long-term rates, in either direction.Estrella has calculated that going back to 1968, every time the long-term rate was at least 0.07 percentage points higher than the short-term rate, the economy escaped recession. 
862	And every time the long-term rate became at least 0.07 percentage points lower  than the short-term rate, the economy entered a recession within six to 17 months. 
863	The average gap so far in December is 0.81 percentage points, which is the biggest since 1981 and deep into recessionary territory. 
864	Why would the “inversion of the yield curve,” as the flipping phenomenon is called, tell us anything about the economic outlook? 
865	It’s pretty simple, actually. 
866	The Federal Reserve has strong influence over short-term interest rates. 
867	When it raises them — usually to snuff out inflation — it makes borrowing more expensive, which often goes too far and causes a recession. 
868	At the same time, longer-term rates can decline because of expectations of lower inflation or a decline in the “real” (inflation-adjusted) rate of interest. 
869	Those expectations intensify when a recession appears likely.A 1989 New York Fed research paper by Estrella and Gikas Hardouvelis, later published in the Journal of Finance, was the first to establish that an inversion of the yield curve predicted recessions, although some other scholars, including Campbell Harvey of Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business, had looked more generally at the yield curve’s predictive value. 
870	Frederic Mishkin, a Columbia University economist who spent time as Estrella’s boss when Mishkin was the New York Fed’s research director, told me: “Arturo was a top intellect. Boy, he really had the goods.”Estrella has a story about how he accidentally angered E. Gerald Corrigan, who was the president of the New York Fed at the time. 
871	A Fed governor in Washington had put out a request for research on whether there was predictive power in the yield curve and Corrigan put his people to work on it, hoping to show that the answer was no. 
872	Not knowing of Corrigan’s preferences, Estrella innocently reported in a big meeting that yes, indeed, his research showed that the yield curve had predictive power. 
873	“His reaction was not something you can print in the paper,” Estrella said. 
874	“I thought I was going to get fired. A few months later, I was transferred to bank supervision.” (Albeit with a promotion.) Estrella told me his interest in the predictive power of interest rates dates back to his childhood in San Juan, P.R., where he attended Catholic schools. 
875	“My math teacher was a nun,” he said. 
876	“She was also in charge of the music program. We hit it off very well.” 
877	He earned a bachelor’s degree in philosophy at Columbia with a special interest in Ludwig Wittgenstein, the kind of philosopher beloved by the technically minded. 
878	He followed that with master’s degrees in math at the University of Puerto Rico and the University of Michigan and a doctorate in economics at Harvard.Estrella left the Fed in 2008 and taught at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., until 2018, when he took emeritus status. 
879	I asked him what he thinks of the Fed’s aggressive rate increases. 
880	“It’s a very difficult line to draw, whether something is necessary to control inflation or not,” he said. 
881	“I don’t know if what they’re doing right now is necessary. My gut feeling is that they’re going too far.”About three-quarters of occupations in the United States became more “age-friendly” between 1990 and 2020, but a lot of the new jobs were filled by young people, according to a working paper  released on the National Bureau of Economic Research website in September. 
882	“Many of these age-friendly jobs have been taken up by females and college graduates, as the occupational characteristics preferred by older workers (e.g., flexibility, office work, less strenuous demands, etc.) also appeal to these groups,” wrote Daron Acemoglu of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Nicolaj Sondergaard Muhlbach of Aarhus University in Denmark and Andrew J. Scott of London Business School.

884	A fierce winter storm is expected to unleash a combination of heavy snowfall, freezing rain and bone-chilling winds across the Central and Eastern United States in the coming days. 
885	A blast of Arctic air will also plunge much of the country into bitter and, in some cases, dangerous cold, forecasters say.The frightful conditions are already afflicting parts of the West, with airports canceling and delaying hundreds of flights ahead of the holiday weekend. 
886	Across the nation’s middle, warnings from the authorities were growing increasingly ominous. 
887	Front line workers are also becoming apprehensive of what some forecasters have described as a “once-in-a-generation storm.” 
888	Brian Hurley, a senior forecaster for the National Weather Service’s Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Md., said that the gravest concerns at this time were for blizzard conditions, as well as the precipitous drop in temperature and wind chill expected across several states.
889	“It’s going to be very cold during the day,” Mr. Hurley said. 
890	“We are expecting some record lows.”Here’s a breakdown of how each region could be affected:Degrees warmer or cooler than average for Dec. 23Sources: PRISM Climate Group at Oregon State University (daily average minimum temperatures for 1991-2020); National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (daily forecast minimum temperatures)By Zach LevittThe “record-breaking” cold air mass has already enveloped some parts of the region between the Rocky Mountains and the Sierra Nevada, as well as the Central Plains, and will chill the Southern Plains by late Thursday, according to the National Weather Service . 
891	Temperatures across the region have already plummeted to minus 10 to minus 20 degrees, with bone-chilling wind gusts of up to 60 miles per hour creating wind chills as low as minus 40 degrees, forecasters say. 
892	In some parts of this area, the wind chill could reach as low as minus 70 degrees, according to the Weather Service. 
893	Without adequate precautions, these conditions can cause frostbite in under five minutes, said the service, “with hypothermia and death also possible from prolonged exposure to the cold.” 
894	There is also concern for the welfare of livestock, especially if there is a widespread loss of power. 
895	Brief bursts of moderate to heavy snow lasting an hour or two are likely to occur immediately behind the Arctic front. 
896	These so-called snow squalls, when combined with strong wind gusts, can cause whiteouts, leading to “extremely hazardous” travel conditions, the Weather Service said.Late Wednesday, more than 100 vehicles were reported stuck near Rapid City, S.D. The Pennington County Sheriff said all the stranded drivers had been accounted for  within a few hours. 
897	While the majority of the coastal West will be spared the bitter cold and punishing weather, some parts of Oregon and Washington State could experience “significant freezing rain,” the Weather Service said, with the potential for ice accumulation to create dangerous travel conditions and scattered power interruptions. 
898	Wind chill warnings have also been issued for parts of Washington State. 
899	On Thursday evening, temperatures in Texas and the Gulf Coast will likely be in the single digits and teens, about 20 to 30 degrees below normal, forecasters say. 
900	The temperatures could drop rapidly, and in some parts of the region, could remain below freezing for two to three days, according to the Weather Service.Wind chill watches and advisories are in effect for much of the Southeastern U.S. 
901	In parts of Texas, wind chills — a measure of what the combination of temperature and wind feels like to human skin — could reach a dangerous minus 15 degrees, the Weather Service said . 
902	It advised residents to avoid extended time outdoors, and, if they have to brave the cold, to cover exposed skin.In southeast Alabama, southwest Georgia and northern Florida, the Weather Service is warning residents  of dangerous boating conditions and a high risk of rip currents on Friday, followed by below freezing temperatures over the weekend.Subzero to single-digit temperatures are expected throughout much of the Midwest, according to forecasters. 
903	Vast portions of the region are also under winter storm and blizzard warnings . 
904	Such conditions can greatly impair visibility and travel.In Illinois, the Weather Service warned  of bitter wind chills of minus 15 to minus 35 degrees from Thursday night into Saturday, and snowfall of up to four inches on Thursday. 
905	Blizzard conditions, the service said, would be possible from Thursday through Friday night. 
906	The heaviest snowfall, according to forecasters, is likely to occur between Wednesday night and Friday over the Great Lakes, where the total depth could exceed a foot. 
907	Wind gusts of more than 50 m.p.h. will create near-zero visibility, leading to what the Weather Service described as “dangerous, to at times impossible, land and air travel.” 
908	There is also concern for tree damage and widespread power failures. 
909	But the snow doesn’t have to be heavy to become dangerous. 
910	Snow combined with 50 m.p.h. winds across the Plains, through the Midwest and into the Great Lakes will create blizzard conditions with any snow falling or on the ground already. 
911	The potential for this to be a “bomb cyclone,” which is meteorologist jargon for a storm system that drops 24 millibars (a measure of air pressure) or greater in 24 hours or less, will lead to extreme winds across the region. 
912	Cities across the region, including Cleveland and Peoria, Ill., are preparing to open warming centers to allow residents to seek shelter during the storm. 
913	By late Thursday or Friday, the storm system will have reached the Mid-Atlantic, bringing with it moderate to heavy rainfall of one to three inches, forecasters say. 
914	Strong southerly winds, combined with the new moon-tide cycle, could also bring coastal flooding from northern New Jersey to northeast Massachusetts, the Weather Service said. 
915	In parts of Vermont and Maine, heavy rain over a fresh snowpack could lead to flooding, according to the service. 
916	Parts of the central Appalachians may also receive light freezing rain and locally heavy snowfall on Thursday morning. 
917	On Friday, as the Arctic cold front races eastward, temperatures will drop suddenly from the mid to upper 50s down to the 20s or the teens, the service said. 
918	This rapid plunge in temperature can flash freeze wet surfaces like roads and pavements, creating hazardous conditions. 
919	A flash freeze occurs when moisture on surfaces like roadways doesn’t have time to evaporate before temperatures quickly dive below freezing, creating black ice conditions. 
920	While a bout of extreme cold grips western Canada, eastern provinces, including Ontario, should expect a mix of snow and rain on Thursday, followed by plummeting temperatures, heavy bursts of snow and gusty winds over 60 m.p.h., meteorologists say. 
921	“With that quick transition from above zero to below zero, we’re looking at potentially iced roads in some places as well, so extremely difficult travel conditions across southern Ontario,” said Steven Flisfeder, a federal warning preparedness meteorologist.At Toronto’s Pearson International Airport, which is Canada’s busiest transportation hub, travelers are bracing for cancellations and delays . 
922	Heavy snowfall near Vancouver International Airport has already led to the cancellation or delay of hundreds of flights. 
923	The intensity of the snowfall is expected to subside by Saturday evening in Ontario and Quebec, though flurries and snow squalls remain possible in the region surrounding the Great Lakes, forecasters said.Vjosa Isai and Judson Jones  contributed reporting.
924	Frank R. James, who was accused of carrying out the worst attack on the New York subway system in years, is expected to plead guilty to terrorism in connection with an April shooting spree on a train in Brooklyn, his lawyers said Wednesday. 
925	Mr. James’s lawyers said in a letter filed Wednesday in federal court in Brooklyn that he would plead guilty to an 11-count indictment, which charged Mr. James with 10 counts of terrorist attack for each of the 10 people shot in the assault, as well as with a firearms charge. 
926	A judge overseeing the case set a Jan. 3 change-of-plea hearing.On April 12, the authorities said, Mr. James unleashed a barrage of gunfire on an N train during the morning rush hour in Brooklyn. 
927	No one was killed, but the attack rattled many in the city and set off a 31-hour manhunt that culminated in Mr. James’s arrest  in Manhattan. 
928	The assault — which came as New Yorkers were starting to ease back into weekday commutes suspended by the pandemic — seemed to crystallize several New York crises at once: the vulnerability of the transit system and its riders, gaps in mental health care and the paradoxical ability of a suspect to disappear into a city of millions with hundreds of thousands of cameras. 
929	The city seemed to freeze until Mr. James’s arrest. 
930	Mr. James, 63, faces a possible life sentence. 
931	A spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office in Brooklyn, which brought the case, declined to comment.Lawyers for Mr. James declined to comment. 
932	In a brief letter to the court, they wrote that Mr. James, who had earlier entered a not guilty plea, had advised them that he “wishes to schedule a guilty plea.” 
933	Just before 8:30 a.m. on Tuesday, April 12, a man wearing a mask and an orange vest threw two smoke bombs and opened fire on a train car in Sunset Park. 
934	Images of smoke-filled train cars and subway platforms slick with blood flooded social media. 
935	In the ensuing chaos, the shooter escaped and disappeared into the city, but he left behind an array of belongings on the train — including a gun, ammunition, bank cards and a key for a U-Haul — and a trail of video surveillance footage across Brooklyn, according to court filings. 
936	The authorities soon identified Mr. James, who appeared to have planned an attack for days. 
937	He had reserved and paid for a U-Haul van in Philadelphia the week before and had driven it into Brooklyn before dawn that day. 
938	Authorities said he had parked the van in Brooklyn and then entered the subway.There was no clear motive. 
939	Mr. James had in previous weeks posted combative videos on social media, in which he aired grievances about the subway system and other city crime issues. 
940	He had a history of arrests in New York and New Jersey and seemed to have lived  an itinerant and unsettled life.For more than a day after the attack , law enforcement combed the city and its surroundings for Mr. James. 
941	He was arrested in the East Village after several people — including Mr. James himself — called the police tip line to report his whereabouts. 
942	Mr. James has been detained since his arrest at a jail in Brooklyn, just blocks from the subway station where the attack took place. 
943	In court filings, Mr. James’s court-appointed lawyers with the Federal Defenders of New York have noted that he has a history of mental illness. 
944	In November, his lawyers filed a motion seeking to have the trial moved to another district, possibly in Illinois, saying it would be impossible for Mr. James to get a fair trial in Brooklyn.Later that month, Mr. James raised the ire of Judge William F. Kuntz, the judge overseeing the case, when he failed to make a scheduled court appearance. 
945	Judge Kuntz authorized U.S. marshals to bring him to court by force, if necessary, telling the court, “This is not a high school prom invitation. It is not his call whether he quote-unquote elects to be here.” 
946	Mr. James appeared in court several hours later. 
947	The announcement of the change of plea came one day after Mr. James’s lawyers requested an adjournment of the trial, which had been set for late February, citing delays in the government’s production of evidence. 
948	Judge Kuntz denied the motion.
949	Times Insider  explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.Since 2000, Kenneth Chang has covered a lot of news for The New York Times — worldly and extraterrestrial. 
950	As a science reporter, Mr. Chang has stood by at NASA launch sites, waiting for rockets to lift off to the moon. 
951	(They sometimes don’t.) 
952	He has profiled a chemist with onstage ambitions. 
953	And he has spoken with experts about the advancements this month in nuclear fusion , the effort to reproduce the sun’s power in a lab — and what that might mean for the future of energy. 
954	Mr. Chang holds a bachelor’s degree in physics and worked on a Ph.D. in the subject before he decided to become a reporter. 
955	That experience, he says, helps him parse complicated concepts for readers, or at least gives him an idea of exactly what he should be asking while on the job. 
956	In an interview, Mr. Chang spoke about how he stays informed on his beat, the joy he still feels from reporting on a new discovery and how he breaks down advanced concepts for readers. 
957	This interview has been edited.Would you consider this a more exciting time than usual for a science reporter? 
958	It’s always exciting. 
959	In fusion, this is a major landmark. 
960	In particle physics, the big announcement was the Higgs boson collider a while back, and that’s been quiet the last few years. 
961	And there are a lot of areas where there are interesting things being done in solid state of physics with strange metals, which, if nothing else, has a really cool name. 
962	Once in a while there’s a big burst of different things that happen. 
963	The science beat is fun because there’s always something new and unexpected.Does your sense of wonder or joy remain intact after covering the beat for some time now? 
964	I studied physics in college and went to grad school hoping to become a physicist. 
965	The romantic notion of physics is that you want to understand the universe, and physics is trying to break it down to the most fundamental laws — what the universe is made out of, what’s going to happen to the universe. 
966	All the wonderful, big questions. 
967	Eventually I came to the conclusion that I’m fine if someone else figures it out and just tells me the answer. 
968	That’s still what I’m doing. 
969	I find that I have a better understanding now of the big picture when I’m doing these stories than when I was a grad student focusing on one small problem, not really understanding the equation or what my next step should be. 
970	It’s great because it’s a license to actually wallow in wonder as a job.What are you most excited about covering? 
971	Mars is always interesting because there’s that lingering question of what was early Mars like? 
972	Life might have been there when that planet was much warmer and wetter. 
973	Maybe it was, maybe it wasn’t, but it’s an understanding of what leads to life and what doesn’t.There’s a similar parallel path of inquiry with exoplanets. 
974	We can start to see thousands of planets. 
975	We can start seeing which ones seem to have conditions that are favorable to life, which ones you can find signs of oxygen in the atmosphere — which isn’t definitive proof of life, but it could be the product of photosynthesis. 
976	This is a level of inquiry that didn’t exist before. 
977	And I wonder where are the aliens? 
978	There’s also this longstanding question of why does the universe exist at all? 
979	That’s something I’m hoping someone will tell me soon.How would you describe your beat? 
980	I usually say that health is stuff that can kill you, technology is stuff that can kill other people, and science is everything in between that doesn’t have any practical application.Do you have your own journalistic methodology to try to explain headier topics to readers? 
981	I try to do enough interviews and digging so that I understand it well enough on a semitechnical level. 
982	My test is if I can explain it well enough to someone else on a more general level. 
983	If I don’t understand it, then that becomes really, really painful and hard. 
984	If I can explain it in a way that feels like it’s not too tortured, that means I’ve actually done a good job. 
985	If it sounds vague, and I can tell that I really am trying to skip over something and hoping you don’t notice, that usually means there’s a gap in my knowledge as well.How much does your experience in physics come in handy? 
986	The useful part is that I understand more about how science is done. 
987	I can ask about the errors, the important questions of is it definite, or is it the first step out of 10 in what you want to discover? 
988	That helps. 
989	There are a lot of really good science reporters who don’t have a direct science background. 
990	But it’s helpful.
991	On a brisk morning in November, bright yellow leaves from a huge ginkgo tree scattered onto the front yard of 87 MacDonough Street. 
992	Under peeling paint and missing cornices, Essie Gregory stood on the steps of the ramshackle mansion in the heart of the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn with a small group of visitors. 
993	As a passer-by craned his neck to see what was going on, Ms. Gregory, 74, opened the front door, giving her guests a rare glimpse inside the New York headquarters of the United Order of Tents Eastern District No. 3. 
994	And despite the water damage, boarded up windows and crumbling plaster, it was just possible to imagine the mysterious building as it once was. 
995	For generations, the Tents — members of a secret society of Black women whose 19th-century founders had once been enslaved — held meetings upstairs, cooked meals in the kitchen and performed secret ceremonies in the parlor. 
996	The Tents have not disappeared. 
997	In fact, their membership is growing, and they have ambitious plans for the future. 
998	But first, they have an urgent item on their agenda: saving the headquarters. 
999	The Tents have been fighting various real estate and tax battles for almost 10 years, and risk a tax lien — which could result in losing the property. 
1000	In addition, the building is in dire need of expensive repairs and restoration. 
1001	Still, the once grand old mansion remains the heart of the organization.
1002	“That building is a symbol of a legacy,” said Akosua Levine, 71, a member of the Tents who has lived in Brooklyn since the 1970s. 
1003	“Women that were enslaved, freed slaves — they did with nothing. So in the 21st century, we have no excuse for that building, for that legacy, not to continue. We have to value our culture.” 
1004	The United Order of Tents, which dates back to 1848, has ties to the Underground Railroad and a mission to care for the aged, respectfully bury the dead and promote sisterhood. 
1005	While there are flourishing Tents chapters across the South, the Brooklyn group is the last remaining club in what was once the Eastern District, stretching from Massachusetts to Pennsylvania. 
1006	Ms. Gregory, a military veteran originally from South Carolina, has been a member since 1997. 
1007	That year, she witnessed the Tents perform a secret ritual, which she declined to describe. 
1008	But, she said with a smirk, “I was curious.” 
1009	She asked to join and soon found she was one of the youngest women in the group.The women were wary, she said: “They were doing all the good things that the Tents did, but they were not really inviting new members in. They didn’t put themselves out there.” 
1010	In fact, only one person has joined the Tents in the 20 years following Ms. Gregory’s initiation. 
1011	But over the past few years, Ms. Gregory has been working on raising the profile of the Tents in the community — and taking in new members. 
1012	Membership had declined to just eight women. 
1013	Now the number stands at 24 — and there are Tents as young as 25.A new generation is intrigued by the secrecy, interested in the community work and fascinated by the origin story of the Tents, Ms. Gregory said. 
1014	“The new membership we have received, they all got interested in the Tents from the history. They want that legacy of the founders to go forth.”One of the newest members is Erica Buddington, 35, an educator and public historian born and raised in Brooklyn. 
1015	“Once you’re in, it’s really about just the service work,” she said. 
1016	“They get straight to it.”Immediately, membership was emotionally overwhelming, Ms. Buddington said. 
1017	“That first day, being in conversation with those elders, I just was like, I don’t want to leave,” she said. 
1018	“I’ve never been in a room with this much knowledge at once. And I’ve been in rooms with Ph.D.s and scientists.”The United Order of Tents was founded by Annetta M. Lane and Harriett Taylor. 
1019	As Suzanne Spellen, a writer and architectural historian who conducts Brooklyn neighborhood walking tours, wrote for Brownstoner, “They began the lodge as a station on the Underground Railroad, shepherding escaping slaves to the North and to freedom in Canada. Often the escapees would huddle in tents, hiding in woods and remote places, giving birth to the organization’s name.”Kaitlyn Greenidge, a novelist who attended a Southern District Tents convention in 2017 and wrote about her experiences and the history of the group, was impressed that for decades the Tents supplied loans and mortgages to Black families when banks refused to. 
1020	The organization offered security, both financial and physical: “They were able to operate and run an elderly home for older Black people  within the community for something like 150 years with no outside financial help or no outside grants,” she said. 
1021	The Order also helped provide proper burials for those who had died in poverty. 
1022	“The Tents were one of the organizations that gathered money to help people have funerals and be buried with a headstone,” Ms. Spellen said. 
1023	In Brooklyn, the group has become inseparable from the striking mansion, which today inspires reverence despite heartache over its current state of disrepair. 
1024	Gold plaques and fading photographs of women in robes adorn the walls of the parlor. 
1025	An ornate wooden mirror, 10 feet high or more, stands at the front of the room. 
1026	Wooden stairs with carved detailing on the balustrade lead up three stories high. 
1027	Built in 1863 for a brewer named William Parker, the house originally sat on a large lot with a carriage house. 
1028	The second owner of the mansion was James McMahon, the president of Emigrant Industrial Savings Bank. 
1029	The Tents purchased it in 1945.“It’s a building that really reflects the urban development of Brooklyn,” said Blaire Walsh, the director of preservation services at the New York Landmarks Conservancy, which has committed to assisting the Tents. 
1030	“This was a very suburban place until the Brooklyn Bridge opened.” 
1031	When the Tents purchased the building some 80 years after it was constructed, Bed-Stuy was a major cultural center for Black New Yorkers, many of whom had moved North from the South, in addition to those who left the crowded buildings of Harlem for more spacious brownstones in Brooklyn. 
1032	The Tents held springtime events in the yard, grew vegetables in the garden, and tended to sick, old and poor women. 
1033	There were Thanksgiving dinners for the community and toy drives for Christmas. 
1034	But as the years passed, the group’s members aged and passed on. 
1035	Funds dwindled. 
1036	The house became harder and harder to maintain.In 2011, the Tents sold the back part of their large lot to a developer  and used the money for some repairs. 
1037	But that only created more problems.A contractor hired to work on the building ended up removing some original molding and paneling, and crucial projects were left unfinished. 
1038	“I cried,” Ms. Levine recalled. 
1039	“Because it’s like my heart. You’re hurting my heart.”There were other financial challenges, as reported by Curbed . 
1040	Because the building was often unoccupied during the pandemic, when the Tents filed for exemption from local property taxes, the Department of Finance turned them down, said Jacques David, a senior staff attorney at the Legal Aid Society. 
1041	He added that the city agency believed that the building was vacant, and that the Tents hadn’t proved that they would use the property for tax-exempt purposes in the foreseeable future.Mr. 
1042	David has been representing the Tents since 2014. 
1043	“We’ve been through quite a bit together,” he said. 
1044	“At each step, when I think that we’ve cleared the final hurdle, there’s another hurdle.” 
1045	The group’s current property tax bill tops $400,000.Restoration of the mansion would mean preserving many aspects of Brooklyn’s history, said Ms. Walsh. 
1046	“This history of public health, the Great Migration, the flourishing of Bedford-Stuyvesant, an African American community — all of these additional layers, and it’s a group that has direct links to enslavement and Reconstruction. It’s just this legacy that’s so incredible. And the building tells all of these different, multifaceted stories.” 
1047	The building is protected as part of the Stuyvesant Heights Historic District, so it likely will not be demolished, regardless of the tax dispute. 
1048	But for the Tents to continue to use it, the expenses will be considerable. 
1049	“I’m thinking we’re definitely looking in the hundreds of thousands,”Ms. 
1050	Walsh said. 
1051	Kelly Britt, an assistant professor of anthropology at Brooklyn College who focuses on historical archaeology, said that the mansion should be preserved not because of its architectural value, but because of what the walls have seen: the Tents in action.That said, “They need money,” Ms. Britt acknowledged. 
1052	“They need money to deal with the house. They need money to deal with the issues with the city and the taxes. And they need money to be able to do what they want to do to help the community.”Ms. 
1053	Buddington noted that many enclaves of Black history in New York City “have been wiped from the map.” 
1054	Brooklyn has many street signs and neighborhoods that “are holding up the names of Dutch and English enslavers,” she said. 
1055	“Yet we cannot keep Black spaces intact. That is big for me. We need to remember some of those spaces.” 
1056	The Tents have laid out a plan — which they will share with the Department of Finance — detailing what the future with a fully repaired and restored house serving the community could look like: a small museum with archival materials. 
1057	A community garden on the grounds. 
1058	They envision a big kitchen for conversations with food historians, cooking demonstrations and tastings. 
1059	A dedicated art gallery. 
1060	Health screenings and flu shots. 
1061	But first they have to save the house.
1062	“That building is a beacon of light,” Ms. Levine said. 
1063	“It’s a beacon of where we came from, and where we can be. We have a foundation. If we get weak: Look at that building. If we feel like we can’t go on anymore: Look at that building.”Despite being a new member, Ms. Buddington said that she feels the pull of 87 MacDonough on a deep level. 
1064	“There is a heavy imprint here of folks that migrated from the South, from the Caribbean, from Africa and established roots here for us,” she said. 
1065	“And I really feel like when I walk into those spaces, they’re saying, stay. Stay.”
1066	Sonya Eddy, who played the no-nonsense head nurse Epiphany Johnson in more than 500 episodes of the enduring ABC soap opera “General Hospital,” died on Monday at a hospital in Burbank, Calif. 
1067	She was 55. 
1068	The cause was an infection following nonemergency surgery, said Tyler Ford, her producing partner.Ms. 
1069	Eddy joined the cast of “General Hospital” in 2006 and quickly established herself as a fan favorite as the head nurse of the hospital where much of the show is set. 
1070	“General Hospital,” a fixture of ABC’s daytime lineup for nearly six decades , follows the adventures of characters who live in the fictional town of Port Charles, N.Y.Frank Valentini, the executive producer of “General Hospital,” said in a statement, “The lights in the hub of the nurse’s station will now be a little dimmer, but her spirit and light will live on in both the show and our set.” 
1071	Ms. Eddy appeared in 543 episodes in 16 years on the show, the most recent of which aired on Oct. 20. 
1072	She also played Epiphany in 25 episodes in the spinoff “General Hospital: Night Shift” in 2007 and 2008. 
1073	The character was the mother of Stan Johnson, who was killed in a mob hit.Sonya Eddy was born on June 17, 1967, in Concord, Calif. 
1074	She was a theater and dance major at the University of California, Davis, where she received her bachelor’s degree in 1992, according to IMDb.com.

1080	Her film credits include “Barbershop,” “Coach Carter” and “Matchstick Men.” 
1081	But her most enduring role was as Epiphany on “General Hospital.” 
1082	She must have appeared credible as a nurse because she played one several times throughout her career, including in the film “Seven Pounds,” from 2008, starring Will Smith, and “Year of the Dog,” from 2007.

1087	ACROSS THE COUNTRY Miles from South Beach and most of Miami’s tourist haunts, Santa’s Enchanted Forest has dazzled locals for decades.WHY WE’RE HERE We’re exploring how America defines itself one place at a time. 
1088	In Miami, a holiday theme park has for decades embodied the city’s distinct mix of cultures.By Patricia MazzeiPhotographs by Scott McIntyre MEDLEY, Fla. 
1089	— Fake snow blows on a gravel lot to greet visitors at one of South Florida’s most enduring Christmas traditions. 
1090	Past a tunnel of blinding colored lights, dioramas celebrate the holiday with a subtropical twist: Santa on a Jet Ski. 
1091	Santa on a fishing boat. 
1092	Surfing Santa. 
1093	Food vendors hawk Brazilian picanha steak and dulce de leche churros. 
1094	“All I Want for Christmas Is You” blares over loudspeakers in Spanish. 
1095	A 100-foot artificial tree lights up in sync to reggaeton and Latin trap tunes. 
1096	This is Santa’s Enchanted Forest, Miami’s interpretation of an American Christmas.For 39 years, miles from South Beach and most of Miami’s tourist haunts, the seasonal theme park known simply as Santa’s has been a mainstay of the holiday season. 
1097	Though it is now in its third location in four years after its longtime lease expired — and the enchanted forest now consists of trees that had to be trucked in  — its garish lights and throwback kitsch continue to symbolize Christmas for many of the region’s working-class people. 
1098	Many are immigrants; some have never seen real snow or been able to afford a Disney vacation.
1099	“There was no Christmas in Cuba,” said GiGi Diaz, 37, who immigrated to Miami as a child and has visited Santa’s most years since. 
1100	“I had never seen a Christmas tree. I learned the concept of Santa Claus when I was 10 years old.”While in high school, she and other girls in a dance group recorded a jingle for Santa’s  that still plays on the radio during the holiday season. 
1101	She now brings students from the dance academy she owns to perform at the theme park. 
1102	“It’s a place where you can be a kid again,” Ms. Diaz said.In a city with little interest in tradition , Santa’s has become a touchstone where adults who came as teenagers now bring their children, and vendors run booths once operated by their parents. 
1103	“I remember being 3 years old and running in to get my face painted,” said Karly Calvo, 28, whose father, Carlos, ran the Santa photo booth and several food stands for 37 years. 
1104	After his death in April, she took charge.
1105	“People I don’t know come up to me all the time: ‘Your dad was here when I was a kid!’” she said. 
1106	“Sometimes I do feel he’s with me in spirit.” 
1107	She still gets her face painted almost every day over the roughly two months a year that Santa’s is open.
1108	“All right, darling,” Jackie Jorge, a makeup artist, told Ms. Calvo as she put the finishing touches of glitter on her face with a Q-Tip on a recent Friday evening. 
1109	“One, two, three: Beautiful!” 
1110	At a nearby picnic table, the Leon family, which had arrived early to beat the crowds, was getting ready to head home. 
1111	Jendry Leon, 33, had come with his wife, mother and 12-year-old son, David, a fan of corn dogs and the Ferris wheel. 
1112	“We come every year,” Mr. Leon said. 
1113	“We used to come when he was a boy,” Mr. Leon’s mother, Milagros Rumbaut, 55, chimed in. 
1114	“We’d say, ‘OK, it’s Christmas. Time to go to Santa’s!’” 
1115	Mr. Leon recalled. 
1116	I braved the traffic on the Palmetto Expressway to visit Santa’s recently — I confess, for the first time, having somehow dodged it as an undergraduate at the University of Miami. 
1117	I wanted to understand why it was so beloved by friends and acquaintances who rarely miss a year of attendance, and what that loyalty said about Miami culture.
1118	“It sounds insane to call Santa’s Enchanted Forest ‘culture,’” said Alex Fumero, 40, a film and television producer from Miami who a decade ago referenced the theme park in a video titled, “12 Days of Miami Christmas.” 
1119	(“On the 10th day of Christmas, Abuela gave to me / 10 bucks off at Santa’s.”)“People know that there’s Cubans and Latinos,” said Mr. Fumero, who now lives in Los Angeles. 
1120	“But they don’t really know that there’s also this second-generation culture that’s native to Miami that’s the result of all this Latin American immigration.” 
1121	Like others who were raised in Miami, Mr. Fumero grew up speaking English at least half the time but frequently slips into Spanish — “I didn’t know I had an accent til I left,” he said — and has embraced both traditional American holiday customs and more brash South Florida flair.Santa’s encapsulates that, he said: “There’s Santa Claus and Christmas trees and lights, but there’s also an Avalanche ride that goes backwards really fast, and they’re just blaring booty music on it.”“I looked for Santa’s here in L.A.,” he added, a little forlorn. 
1122	“And it does not exist.”I had planned to go to Santa’s in Decembers past, but it had never panned out. 
1123	Then, in early 2020, Santa’s lease at its longtime location, Tropical Park , first signed in 1992, expired. 
1124	Its landlord, Miami-Dade County, did not renew it. 
1125	The coronavirus pandemic kept Santa’s closed, and I worried I had missed my chance.Santa’s returned last year, but its new home in the heavily Cuban city of Hialeah, just northwest of Miami, was so cramped that entrance lines  were two hours long. 
1126	Parking, of utmost concern to South Floridians, was a nightmare. 
1127	The theme park finds itself in yet another setting this year:a 40-acre lot in Medley, an industrial town near Miami International Airport. 
1128	Parking is not a problem, but the namesake “forest,” a reference to Tropical Park’s many tall trees, is gone. 
1129	“You walked through there and it was like Miami’s version of magic,” said Billy Corben, a documentary filmmaker whose Jewish grandparents were friends with Santa’s Jewish founder, Jerry A. Shechtman. 
1130	Mr. Shechtman died in 1995; his son Steven now owns the operation. 
1131	When Mr. Corben’s cousins would visit over the holidays, three generations would caravan in multiple cars to Santa’s, where they had devised a strategic route to hit favorite food vendors and rides. 
1132	“I’m not going because it’s in Medley now,” Mr. Corben declared at one point in our interview. 
1133	Then he kept reminiscing.
1134	“We don’t really have a lot of common culture anymore,” he said, pointing to South Florida’s transient population and lack of institutional memory. 
1135	“With all the tribalism of Miami, Santa’s very much felt like Switzerland. Like kind of neutral territory.”“There’s just great memories there, and I think that’s probably true for any Jew you ask, any Cuban you ask, any Haitian you ask,” he continued. 
1136	“And how many of those things do we have?” 
1137	The fajitas at Santa’s were so good, Mr. Corben said, that he once tried to buy some from the side of the highway, through the Tropical Park fence. 
1138	Ward Deal, who runs the Viva la Fajita stand, told me that many of his devoted customers tried to do that at Santa’s previous location.
1139	“People email me to find out if I’m here and figure out if they should get a season pass,” he said. 
1140	“I see generations of kids that were here in strollers and are now here with their own families.” 
1141	(The chicken fajita with guacamole did not disappoint.)Mr. 
1142	Corben said going to Santa’s “felt kind of pure.”“It was naked capitalism,” he conceded. 
1143	(Tickets for ages 9-64 are $42.99 a pop.) 
1144	“But it also felt like this sort of benevolent thing. They gave us this Christmas gift.” 
1145	He paused. 
1146	“Maybe we’ll go this year,” he said.Susan C. Beachy and Kirsten Noyes  contributed research.

1161	The enduring memory for me is the noise. 
1162	That, and the often forgotten confusion over an obscure N.F.L. rule that almost annulled the “Immaculate Reception.”The announcement of Franco Harris’s death  on Wednesday, just two days before the 50th anniversary of the unforgettable play, calls up a swirl of memories for me, some because I was in the stands at the game, some from having been in the Pittsburgh universe then. 
1163	Back then, the Steelers’ historic ineptitude was a notable backdrop to that 1972 playoff game. 
1164	The team had previously made it to the postseason only once in its 40-year history — and that had been in 1947. 
1165	The Steelers were the Houston Texans of their day. 
1166	Luckily for me, my father had seen promise in this version of the team and bought season tickets, meaning we would be among the fortunate 50,000 people in Pittsburgh who could watch the game as it happened. 
1167	In those days before the N.F.L. fully boomed in popularity, the league believed live broadcasts in the home team’s city would deter ticket sales — and the rule weirdly applied even to a sold-out playoff game. 
1168	The game was a brutal defensive battle in the December cold, with a scoreless first half. 
1169	The Steelers built a 6-0 lead on two field goals, but then what had seemed inevitable finally happened: The favored Raiders scored a touchdown with just over a minute left.Things looked grim. 
1170	Friends who came with us left to beat the crowd. 
1171	(Regrets? They have a few.) 
1172	Thankfully, my father is a big believer in staying to the end. 
1173	You never know what will happen, he says — a lesson he learned after once missing an unlikely finish to a basketball game. 
1174	So there we were, standing at our seats in the end zone behind the play and, like all the other Steelers fans, holding only the faintest hope as that desperate fourth-down play unfolded. 
1175	Our hopes collapsed when Terry Bradshaw’s long pass bounced away from John “Frenchy” Fuqua and into the air. 
1176	In my memory, there was a shared groan throughout the stadium.And then! 
1177	Bedlam. 
1178	Harris was running, the crowd was roaring, the referees were huddling. 
1179	Had the ball touched a Raider after it bounced off Fuqua, or had it bounced from one Steeler to the next? 
1180	The rules at the time didn’t allow a player to deflect a pass to his own teammate, even inadvertently. 
1181	It would have taken a bold official to rule the play illegal with a jubilant crowd spilling into the end zone around him, and of course the play stood. 
1182	Hours later, the broadcaster Myron Cope, himself a beloved Pittsburgh character, took a call from a listener whose friend had christened the play “The Immaculate Reception.” 
1183	The legend had its necessary luster. 
1184	In a blink, Harris had become the prince of Pittsburgh. 
1185	His fans, playing off his mother’s heritage, labeled themselves “Franco’s Italian Army” and even Frank Sinatra joined their ranks. 
1186	The Steelers lost to the Dolphins in the next round, but won four Super Bowls in the next eight years. 
1187	Harris went on to become the second-leading rusher in league history, earn induction into the Hall of Fame and see his statue placed next to George Washington’s in Pittsburgh International Airport. 
1188	He remained humble, even as a 22-year-old in the delirious moment of his most famous touchdown. 
1189	That grace and good will made him all the more beloved. 
1190	His army of fans remains, if in unexpected mourning as we prepare to honor the anniversary of the catch that still conjures the thought of divine intervention.
1191	Caleb and Kate get into a terrible argument. 
1192	Like most couples, they “loved each other, but not every single minute.” 
1193	Caleb storms out, “hating his wife from top to bottom,” but he soon cools off, having forgotten what the fight was even about. 
1194	Before he returns to make up with Kate, however, he sits down to rest, and while he’s dozing, a passing witch casts a spell. 
1195	When the unsuspecting Caleb wakes up, he’s a dog.Well, these things happen — in children’s books. 
1196	But while stupid fights, witches and magic spells are all common elements in stories for young people, what’s uncommon about William Steig’s 1977 picture book, “Caleb and Kate,”  is that not a single child appears in its pages. 
1197	Nor do they in several of Steig’s other beloved children’s books, at least not as main characters, whether monsters (“Shrek!”) or not.
1198	“I never am trying to get anything across,” William Steig said of “Caleb and Kate” in an interview at the time. 
1199	“I think it’s deadly. It ruins writing to have purposes like that.” 
1200	Steig may not have been trying to send a message to children, but children got the message anyway. 
1201	“Caleb and Kate” acknowledges a world in which adults — even a reader’s parents — fight, but the world doesn’t end when they do. 
1202	Moreover, it suggests that grown-up fights can be just as ludicrous as children’s squabbles, and adults can behave in equally rash and regrettable ways. 
1203	They’re just grown-ups, after all — and this is both comforting and amusing information for children to absorb.
1204	“Children see the adult world as mysterious and fascinating — and one they want to know,” said Leonard Marcus, a historian of children’s literature. 
1205	“To be able to see into this secret world through children’s books creates a kind of empathy.”Yet the adult protagonist has become a rare figure in American children’s books. 
1206	With a few notable exceptions — “A Sick Day for Amos McGee” by Philip C. Stead and Erin E. Stead, and several titles by the author-illustrator Jon Agee come to mind — most children’s books today are deeply child-centric. 
1207	This shift began in the 1960s, with the rise of developmental psychology, and intensified from the 1980s onward. 
1208	“It’s become kind of codified that books for children should be about  young children,” Marcus said, with a rule of thumb holding that the protagonist, whether animal or human, be the same age or slightly older than the reader.But that’s a rule worth questioning. 
1209	Some might see the entrenchment of child-centeredness in children’s literature as reinforcing what some social critics consider a rising tide of narcissism in young people today. 
1210	But to be fair: Such criticisms of youth transcend the ages. 
1211	What is certainly true now is the primacy of “mirrors and windows,”  a philosophy that strives to show children characters who reflect how they look back to them, as well as those from different backgrounds, mostly with an eye to diversity. 
1212	This is a noble goal, but those mirrors and windows should apply to adults as well. 
1213	Adults are, after all, central figures in children’s lives — their parents and caregivers, their teachers, their role models. 
1214	They are also children’s future selves. 
1215	What better way to understand these overgrown children than to inhabit their points of view? 
1216	And yes, adults are often the Other — which makes them a mystery and a curiosity. 
1217	Literature offers insight into these occasionally intimidating creatures.The adult figures in children’s literature are also frequently outsiders or eccentrics in some way, and quite often subject to ridicule. 
1218	They are the house painter Mr. Popper, who finds himself living with 12 penguins. 
1219	They are boring Officer Buckle , who just wants to impart safety tips. 
1220	The implicit lesson is that grown-ups aren’t infallible. 
1221	It’s OK to laugh at them and it’s OK to feel compassion for them and it’s even OK to feel sorry for them on occasion.In one of my favorite picture books, “The Story of Mrs. Lovewright and Purrless Her Cat,”  written by Lore Segal and illustrated by Paul O. Zelinsky, the dour Mrs. Lovewright is seemingly without company other than that of the grocery deliveryman Dylan — until he delivers a kitten at her request. 
1222	“I don’t care what color so it’s little and cute and purrs on my lap,” she instructs him. 
1223	She names her tabby Purrly so that he knows what he must do. 
1224	But she quickly learns what every child must learn: You cannot force anyone — animal or human — to do exactly what you want, let alone to love you as you demand. 
1225	It’s a profound lesson, more easily absorbed when delivered by a fussy old lady with flawed assumptions. 
1226	In real life, children revere adults and they fear them. 
1227	It only follows, then, that they appreciate when adult characters behave admirably but also delight in seeing the consequences — especially when rendered with humor — when they don’t. 
1228	Nursery rhymes, folk tales, myths and legends overwhelmingly cast adults as their central characters — and have endured for good reason. 
1229	Think the old woman who lived in the shoe and the villagers who prepare stone soup. 
1230	For decades, children have gravitated toward the fully adult gods and goddesses of ancient Greece, Rome, Egypt and Scandinavia and have gathered at the round table in King Arthur’s court.In somewhat later tales, children investigated crimes alongside Sherlock Holmes, adventured through Narnia, inhabited Oz and traversed Middle-earth. 
1231	Grown-up heroes can be hobbits, or rabbits (“Watership Down”), badgers or moles (“The Wind in the Willows”). 
1232	Children join them no matter what because they like to be in league with their protagonists and by extension, their authors. 
1233	As John Updike once wrote, in a children’s book review for The New York Times, “All successful children’s literature has a conspiratorial element.” 
1234	In children’s books with adult heroes, children get to conspire alongside their elders. 
1235	Defying the too-often adversarial relationship between adults and children in literature, such books enable children to see that adults are perfectly capable of occupying their shared world with less antagonism — as partners in life, in love and in adventure.

1242	A chart with an article  on Wednesday about California’s unexpectedly quiet 2022 wildfire season rendered incorrectly the five-year moving average of acres burned. 
1243	That entire line on the chart was too low by roughly 180,000 acres. 
1244	It has been updated to reflect the true values.A picture caption  with an obituary on Wednesday about the film curator Adrienne Mancia, using information from the Museum of Modern Art, misstated the surname of the woman pictured with her and Clint Eastwood. 
1245	She is Mary Lea Bandy, not Brandy.An obituary  on Monday about Audrey Munson, who in the 1910s was the model for numerous monuments in New York City, misstated the year The Sun called her “Miss Manhattan.”

1251	The literary critic Fredric Jameson once said it was easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism. 
1252	But what about Twitter? 
1253	Over the past 15 years, the microblogging service created a remarkably durable digital forum — and within it, a new kind of internet addict, who consumes the world in 280 characters or less, all day long. 
1254	(A few of them even admit they have a problem.) 
1255	Now, amid the chaos of Elon Musk’s early run as chief executive, some of them have started to conceive of the previously inconceivable: the end of their Twitter dependency. 
1256	“If it was gone, I think we’d all be better off,” said Ben Ritz, the director of the Center for Funding America’s Future at the Progressive Policy Institute, a think tank. 
1257	He estimated he uses Twitter three to four hours a day.
1258	“I would have a lot more time in my life,” said Molly Jong-Fast, the Vanity Fair special correspondent and liberal media star .
1259	“What if it did just implode totally?” said Jesse Singal, a journalist and the co-host of “Blocked and Reported,” a podcast about internet controversies, who has himself been the subject of Twitter controversy for his writing on transgender issues. 
1260	“I think I would feel a sense of relief. It would resolve my own tortured relationship with it by default.” 
1261	Founded in 2006, Twitter quickly became a hub and a stage for, among others, journalists, wonks, academics and politicians interested in up-to-the-second news and commentary. 
1262	Many joined out of a sense of professional necessity, as the platform was a place to stay current and build an audience. 
1263	Soon, vernaculars, inside jokes and etiquette particular to Twitter drove users to stay connected, lest they fall behind. 
1264	Over the years, some of those people started to visit the site more and more — and then more often still. 
1265	“I have a constant thought in the back of my mind that I need to check Twitter,” said Matthew Donovan, a host of “Neoliberalhell,” a popular podcast about left-wing politics and internet culture.During the Trump years, as President Donald J. Trump came to dominate the platform with his unfiltered style and relentless pace (he tweeted more than 25,000 times  during his four-year term), some Twitter users found themselves with shortened attention spans, unfinished to-do lists and annoyed family members.
1266	“I walk my parents’ dog with them,” Mr. Ritz said. 
1267	“And when the conversation stops, I check my phone. They’re pretty unhappy with it.” 
1268	Ms. Jong-Fast, who has built a million-follower audience on the platform, said she was so fused to Twitter that she couldn’t escape it, even when she was resting.
1269	“At one point, I closed my eyes and I could see the graphics of the site,” Ms. Jong-Fast said. 
1270	“It’s burned into me.” 
1271	Twitter’s potent brew of breaking news, social competition, professional jockeying, wisecracking and personal abuse has always been an acquired taste, even for the most prolific users. 
1272	That it may not to be healthy to spend so much time on Twitter is a frequent topic of conversation on the site itself. 
1273	Long before Mr. Musk took over as chief executive in October, joking about the platform’s being a “hellsite” had been one of the telltale signs of a hopelessly addicted user. 
1274	For some, what’s good about Twitter — instant access to the thoughts of millions of other people — is also what’s bad about it.Journalism, said Dylan Matthews, a senior correspondent for Vox, “can feel like yelling into the void. What’s specifically addictive about Twitter is it tells you what the void thinks.”But, he added, “I don’t think man was meant to have hundreds of people yelling at them at once and survive psychologically.”Even by the masochistic standards of many longtime Twitter users, Mr. Musk’s reign has been trying: He has — erratically — reworked the site’s verification system. 
1275	He has suspended some journalists, only to reinstate some of them shortly after, and opened some of the company’s internal emails up to others. 
1276	And he has seemingly left significant decisions about the direction of Twitter, including whether to allow previously banned accounts back on the platform and whether he should remain as chief executive , up to simple polls on the platform.Among the users who were banned before Mr. Musk’s purchase who have returned to Twitter thanks to the “general amnesty” plebiscite is Andrew Anglin, the founder of the neo-Nazi site The Daily Stormer. 
1277	(Mr. Musk separately reinstated Mr. Trump, though he hasn’t resumed tweeting.) 
1278	Thousands of Twitter staff have either been laid off  or quit, leading to speculation that the remaining work force is no longer big enough to sustain the site long term. 
1279	Many of the site’s most loyal users are now considering the idea that the platform could lose its status as the central hub of digital media.Mr. 
1280	Matthews, who is concerned about Mr. Musk’s suspension of journalists’ accounts, also considered an intriguing prospect: “Maybe I’m the kind of journalist who could get banned, too,” he remembered thinking. 
1281	“And maybe that would make me happier?”Many users remain on the app, waiting to see what happens. 
1282	Quitting, for them, feels awfully final and extreme given how fast the environment is changing. 
1283	On Tuesday, Mr. Musk said he would resign  as chief executive once he found someone to replace him. 
1284	Micah Musser, a research analyst at a think tank in Washington, D.C., said that even though “it feels like the site has gotten a lot worse,” he still hadn’t left. 
1285	“But it would be good for me, personally,” he said.Indeed, power users find Twitter notoriously hard to quit. 
1286	In July 2021, the writer Caitlin Flanagan published an essay, “You Really Need to Quit Twitter,” in The Atlantic; as of today, she remains on the platform. 
1287	And many of the prominent Twitter users who have created accounts on alternatives like Mastodon and Post are still active on Twitter. 
1288	(Mastodon has a reputation for being difficult to use, and both it and Post face the major obstacle of any Twitter challenger: inertia among users.) 
1289	Mr. Singal, who has previously quit and come back, has deleted the platform’s app from his phone as a first step.
1290	“If I was more mature or psychologically healthy, I could drop it completely,” he said. 
1291	“But I get dragged back into fighting with people, which is totally futile.” 
1292	Still, for those who think Mr. Musk has already taken, or will take, the platform past a point of no return — and can’t yet muster the will to leave — there is at least one success story. 
1293	Jason Stanley, a professor of philosophy at Yale University and the author of “How Fascism Works,” was for years a fixture on the platform, where he tweeted frequently about what he viewed as threats to democracy. 
1294	Along the way, he said, he became addicted. 
1295	“I can’t let go of an argument,” he said. 
1296	Mr. Stanley said that after the 2016 election he quit Facebook, which many liberals argued had played a role in Mr. Trump’s victory. 
1297	When Mr. Musk bought Twitter, Mr. Stanley said he had similarly negative feelings. 
1298	“I’m on Twitter to talk about democracy, and if it’s not going to be that, I have no excuse to be in this kind of sad space,” he said. 
1299	Mr. Stanley quit in early December. 
1300	He said it was easy. 
1301	Among the benefits: His children no longer draw pictures of him with his phone in his hands.
1302	“Being connected to my family is the first, second and third most important thing,” Mr. Stanley said. 
1303	“More important than American democracy, even.”
1304	The studded tires on our rented Toyota minivan were spinning, but we were not getting out of that three-foot snowbank along a remote Icelandic road without some help. 
1305	Fortunately, I spotted a passing 4x4 tour vehicle and flagged down the driver, who shook his head as he rolled down the window. 
1306	“What are you guys doing?” he said. 
1307	Good question.As an automotive writer for The New York Times, I’ve driven a $4 million Bugatti  at 100 miles per hour along the winding Mulholland Highway in Los Angeles, and a Lamborghini at 160 m.p.h. on a track. 
1308	But none of that prepared me to do 30 m.p.h. on a narrow, icy highway in northern Iceland.Four of us — including my wife and two friends — were visiting the Godafoss  waterfall, about 90 miles from the Arctic Circle, on Day 5 of our 13-day circumnavigation of the island. 
1309	It was the third week of October, the temperature was in the 20s and snow already blanketed the roads and fields, the result of a heavy storm the week before. 
1310	We were eager to see the 36-foot-high cascade nicknamed the Waterfall of the Gods, which we expected to be a mostly frozen wonderland of ice and mist. 
1311	To get there quicker, I decided to take an alternative route. 
1312	I had made it only a few yards down the gravel road when I changed my mind. 
1313	Rather than backing out, I did a three-point turn, and soon our van was axle-deep in snow. 
1314	The tour operator attached his winch to a tow hook on the back of our van and began to pull — and pull — until we wound up stuck in another snowdrift, our tires again spinning uselessly. 
1315	Annoyed, he switched the winch to the front of our vehicle and hoisted us out once again. 
1316	Success. 
1317	We learned the hard way that knowing how to drive during American winters does not necessarily translate to Iceland, where snow begins to fall as early as September, and roads are windswept, often unpaved and frequently covered in black ice during the cold months. 
1318	We were planning to drive around Iceland, a nearly Kentucky-size country with a population of about 376,000, on the roughly 830-mile Ring Road, which circles the island. 
1319	That would give us time to see a magical landscape of majestic waterfalls and glacier-filled lagoons, and to take a few mountain hikes in solitude. 
1320	This late in the year, we expected to encounter few tourists, or even Icelanders.We decided to drive clockwise around the island — the opposite direction most tourists take. 
1321	Not only would traffic be lighter, we thought, but we also wanted to start our journey from Reykjavik with the geysers and waterfalls of the popular Golden Circle route, and then see the dramatic basalt cliffs of the Snaefellsnes peninsula  and the black-sand beach at Djupalonssandur, just north of the capital.From there, we planned to drive on to Akureyi , a city perched on a fjord in the far north; then to Myvatn, a vast volcanic lake; and around to two small towns hugging the southern coast. 
1322	We aimed to end up at the famous Blue Lagoon geothermal pools near the airport before flying home. 
1323	With my wife in the passenger seat relaying Google Maps directions to me, we set out with the sun peeking above a lunar landscape. 
1324	The key to driving around Iceland in wintry conditions, we learned, is flexibility: regular monitoring of weather and road conditions, and being ready to alter travel and hotel plans when the Ring Road suddenly shuts because of snow or high winds. 
1325	And the weather can change at any time, going from bright sun to a heavy downpour or a snowstorm.
1326	“I would never drive out of Reykjavik between November and March without winter tires and studs in them,” said Pall Thorsteinsson, the public relations manager for Toyota of Iceland. 
1327	“You need to listen to the weather forecast every four hours, as conditions can change very fast, with heavy winds and piling snow, and no towns for two hours.”Icelandic maps divide roads into five types , from the paved Ring Road, or Route 1, to the mountainous, gravel “F” roads, which are closed to all vehicles from around September until June or July and are not recommended for standard passenger cars at any time. 
1328	Many roads fall somewhere in between, but bad weather can make any thoroughfare much, much worse.
1329	“Tourists rent a small car and then think they can drive around the Ring Road in the winter in four days,” said Gunnar Gunnarsson, the head of safety for the Icelandic Transportation Authority. 
1330	“Icelanders would never do that, as you’ll probably get stuck.” 
1331	In spite of having a vehicle considerably larger than a small car, we certainly learned that lesson at Godafoss. 
1332	But more challenges awaited us on the Ring Road: black ice lurking on the asphalt, a sun that set as early as 4 p.m. and then just peeked above the horizon after 9 a.m., and very high winds that blew unexpectedly. 
1333	Our van’s doors were sometimes ripped out of our hands by powerful gusts that came out of nowhere on an otherwise sunny day. 
1334	My wife twice had the door painfully ram into her ankle without warning. 
1335	Rental car insurance often won’t cover damage to doors from these gusts. 
1336	One thing we got right: We didn’t hit the ground running the moment we landed. 
1337	After waking up at 3 a.m. to get to the Los Angeles airport and then spending 19 hours traveling, we knew we would be in no shape to drive, so we decided to spend the first two nights in Reykjavik. 
1338	Arriving at our hotel at 8:30 a.m., we experienced what felt like the longest day of our lives — much of it in darkness — as we waited to check in at 4 p.m.Most North American visitors arrive at Keflavik airport, about 31 miles from Reykjavik, at around 6 a.m., and many start in the early-morning darkness after getting little to no rest, which can be very dangerous. 
1339	To discourage eager tourists from hitting the roads while half asleep, the government has teamed up with a number of hotels near the airport to offer rooms at a lower price for a few hours. 
1340	The new program, called Nap and Go , lets guests stay in a room until around 2:30 p.m. for about $70. 
1341	Driving on Icelandic roads, even the Ring Road, is not like driving in the United States or Europe. 
1342	The Ring Road is a two-lane, undivided highway with a maximum speed of 90 kilometers per hour, or about 56 m.p.h. Bridges are often one lane and offer limited visibility on the other side. 
1343	Crossing them at 30 m.p.h., I prayed a hidden vehicle wasn’t lurking behind a blind rise. 
1344	To maximize visibility at all times of the day, we had to remember to manually turn on our headlights, because by law both those and the taillights must always be on. 
1345	Leaving the headlight switch in the automatic position will not illuminate the taillights during the day. 
1346	With gas stations sometimes hours apart, we never let the fuel level fall below half a tank; we topped it off daily, at a cost of about $8.70 per gallon. 
1347	And because even the main roads in Iceland are sparsely traveled in the colder months — we typically saw about one vehicle every mile in either direction — tourists often take dangerous risks, such as exceeding the speed limit in icy conditions or stopping in the middle of the road to take a photograph. 
1348	Fines for speeding can run as high as $1,750, according to a spokesperson for the Icelandic police. 
1349	Traveling just 20 kilometers per hour, about 12 m.p.h., over the limit on the Ring Road can result in a $350 fine, payable on the spot via cash or credit card. 
1350	The week before we arrived, a storm had shut parts of the Ring Road, and we feared that if snow or high wind delayed our ambitious schedule, we might miss one or more of our prepaid hotel reservations. 
1351	It turns out our worries were unfounded.
1352	“We very seldom have a problem rebooking someone who is delayed because of road closures,” said Daniel Smarason, the owner of Hotel Akureyri , a hip movie-themed hotel with tiny rooms, converted from one of the country’s oldest cinemas. 
1353	The attached hydroponic farm uses wastewater from the heaters to grow vegetables year-round. 
1354	The hotel was socked in with snow when we arrived.We also arrived without delays at Hotel Laxa , a comfortable spot near Myvatn, drinking Aperol spritzes during its long happy hour and admiring the gorgeous views of a wide snow-covered plain. 
1355	The hotel would have tried to rebook us at no charge if we had been held up by a storm, the manager, Fionn Larkin, told us. 
1356	If the hotel remains inaccessible to guests, he said, it will refund the booking without penalty. 
1357	We were happy to be eating delicious lamb and fish in the restaurant, and that night at about 2 a.m., we awoke to see the spectacular sight of the northern lights shimmering overhead. 
1358	A few days and a few patches of black ice later, we arrived at the Blue Lagoon, but after our journey through the solitude of the Icelandic countryside, the tour buses parked outside dissuaded us from going in to take a preflight soak. 
1359	Instead, our capstone became the Reykjanes peninsula, near Keflavik airport, watching Icelandic horses graze and visiting a desolate seaside church.We had managed to get around the island with only one brief scare. 
1360	But for those who don’t heed warnings and get stuck in snow or ice, there’s no equivalent of the AAA to call. 
1361	While some rental car companies offer roadside assistance, the country maintains a volunteer search-and-rescue team , dispatched after a driver calls the emergency number, 112. 
1362	Fortunately, despite its low population density, Iceland has excellent cellular service, with coverage available virtually everywhere along the Ring Road.The good news is that visitors don’t need to wait until they’re in danger to call for help. 
1363	Before our trip, we could have registered our itinerary and expected arrival times each day on the Safe Travel website . 
1364	If we didn’t notify the site that we had arrived, a search-and-rescue team would have been sent out to look for us. 
1365	After our experience in that snowdrift, we can attest that that’s a comforting fact. 
1366	But some Icelanders, like Mr. Thorsteinsson of Toyota, have their own surefire ways to keep themselves from getting stuck in the snow.

1371	This article is part of a series recounting the stories of people who received help from nonprofit organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. 
1372	It started with a slight limp. 
1373	Early in 2019, at the end of a long day, Verisi Bido noticed that her older son, Jhordens Rivas Bido, was struggling to walk. 
1374	He was an active boy; she thought he must have injured himself at basketball camp or while riding his bike.
1375	“I asked him if he fell,” Ms. Bido recalled, through a translator, in an interview late last month. 
1376	“I never thought it would be something so horrible.” 
1377	Jhordens, then 8 years old, told her that his foot didn’t hurt but that it felt “weird.” 
1378	Something about the description unsettled her. 
1379	Donate now to the 111th annual campaign of The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. 
1380	All proceeds go to organizations providing assistance to those facing economic hardship. 
1381	Make a tax-deductible donation through GoFundMe.
1382	“Chasing the Phantom”; Dewa Alit and Gamelan Salukat (Black Truffle)This Balinese composer combines two different gamelan scales in his latest project. 
1383	Just as you start to grasp the harmonic implications, his ensemble begins navigating virtuoso rhythm changes. 
1384	Recommended if you like innovative tunings, torrid riffing, blooming transitions of percussive color, or hip-hop beat-tapes. 
1385	SETH COLTER WALLS“Mother Sister Daughter”; Musica Secreta; Laurie Stras, director (Lucky Music)Musica Secreta — its name inspired by the mystery still surrounding works written by and for Renaissance and Baroque women — is pressing into tantalizingly early repertoire from around the turn of the 16th century, including this “Vespers of St. Lucy” and other rare polyphonic settings of psalm antiphons (chants sung alongside psalm verses) believed to have originated in Italian convents. 
1386	ZACHARY WOOLFE“Matthäus-Passion”; Lucile Richardot, mezzo-soprano; Pygmalion; Raphaël Pichon, conductor (Harmonia Mundi)It’s been a good year for Raphaël Pichon and his period ensemble Pygmalion: critically adored opera stagings and excellent recordings, including one for the pantheon of “St. Matthew Passion” accounts. 
1387	Hear how, alongside precision, the purity of sound — in the strings, and in Lucile Richardot’s robust yet smooth tone — maintains rending beauty and a softly dancing lilt. 
1388	JOSHUA BARONEBeethoven: “Diabelli” Variations; Mitsuko Uchida, piano (Decca)Mitsuko Uchida playing Beethoven: It’s a self-recommending prospect, really. 
1389	Still, it’s a mark of this pianist’s surpassing artistry that her “Diabellis” prove so unerringly fine. 
1390	There is elegance, of course, and sensitivity; a wink or two of wit even breaks through, though Uchida is not exactly looking for laughs. 
1391	What is so striking, rather, is how scrupulously she rethinks each variation, even as she ensures that each finds its rightful place in the whole. 
1392	DAVID ALLEN“Arias”; Jonathan Tetelman, tenor; Orquesta Filarmónica de Gran Canaria; Karel Mark Chichon, conductor (Deutsche Grammophon)On his debut album, Jonathan Tetelman lavishes his sumptuous tenor and almost poetic attention on classic Romantic and verismo arias. 
1393	For the “Flower Song” from “Carmen,” Tetelman cushions the contours of his phrases, hooks into high notes without breaking the musical line and nails the diminuendo on the high B flat. 
1394	OUSSAMA ZAHR“Walking in the Dark”; Julia Bullock, soprano; Christian Reif, piano (Nonesuch)At last we have a solo album from Julia Bullock. 
1395	As debuts go, it’s eclectic and understated, and astonishing for its intensity of feeling with such restraint — perhaps most so in “One by One.” 
1396	This track, by the pioneering but elusive singer-songwriter Connie Converse, is here whispered and prayerful, with the intimacy and elegance of an Ivesian parlor song. 
1397	JOSHUA BARONE“X: The Life and Times of Malcolm X”; Boston Modern Orchestra Project; Odyssey Opera Chorus; Gil Rose, Conductor (BMOP Sound)In which a young Malcolm Little — not yet surnamed X — receives a tour of Boston while listeners get a sense of what makes Davis one of today’s great opera composers: Simultaneous warmth and apprehension in lines for Malcolm’s sister Ella hint at both spirituals and Berg. 
1398	Yet her warnings collide with a pool hall hustler’s even more compelling pitch, eloquent and brash in the manner of Mingus. 
1399	SETH COLTER WALLS“Pelléas et Mélisande”; Vannina Santoni, soprano; Alexandre Duhamel, baritone; Jean Teitgen, bass; Les Siècles; François-Xavier Roth, conductor (Harmonia Mundi)Closer and closer to our own time stride François-Xavier Roth and the period-instrument players of Les Siècles, and on, too, toward ever more revealing interpretations. 
1400	Supporting somewhat lighter voices than the norm, Les Siècles’ gut strings and piping winds give Debussy’s more delicate writing a glinting fragility, his outbursts of violence a raw savagery. 
1401	This is “Pelléas” not as a mystery play, but as an unsparingly forceful drama. 
1402	DAVID ALLEN“What Is American”; PUBLIQuartet (Bright Shiny Things)Dvorak’s “American” quartet has elicited dozens of winning, faithful recordings. 
1403	This one has other goals. 
1404	As the performers improvise around the original material, they attain a communion with Dvorak’s love of Black American music that most other interpreters fail to achieve. 
1405	SETH COLTER WALLS“Julius Eastman, Vol. 2: Joy Boy”; Wild Up (New Amsterdam)The Los Angeles ensemble Wild Up has embarked on a series of recordings of the once-forgotten music of Julius Eastman (1940-90). 
1406	The second installment closes with the bright party of “Stay On It,” a paean to community that veers between precision and lush chaos: troubled by shadows but ultimately, patiently, quietly triumphant. 
1407	ZACHARY WOOLFE“Amaryllis”; Mary Halvorson Sextet; Mivos Quartet (Nonesuch)After spending part of the pandemic studying up on string quartet writing, this guitarist and composer collaborated with the Mivos Quartet on two enjoyable albums released this year. 
1408	For this exultant and meticulously patterned work, Halvorson invited the string quartet into her standing sextet of improvising players, creating her richest ensemble sound yet. 
1409	SETH COLTER WALLS“Tristan”; Igor Levit, piano; Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra; Franz Welser-Möst, conductor (Sony)Another astonishing recording from the pianist Igor Levit, “Tristan” is bookended by Liszt and includes dreamlike solo transcriptions of the Adagio from Mahler’s 10th Symphony and Wagner’s “Tristan und Isolde” Prelude. 
1410	But the album centers on Hans Werner Henze’s postmodern “Tristan” (1973), which musters piano, tape and orchestra to reckon with the Germanic tradition, furthering Liszt, Wagner and Mahler’s bendings of time and harmony. 
1411	ZACHARY WOOLFE“Hollywood Soundstage”; Sinfonia of London; John Wilson, conductor (Chandos)It would be easy to argue that a track from any of the five sensational recordings John Wilson and his elite Sinfonia of London have released this year should be on this list, but every time I play this Korngold, I find it hard to move on to anything else. 
1412	The virtuosity Wilson lavishes on a composer he is determined to restore to stature is stunning, no matter how many times you hear it. 
1413	DAVID ALLEN“Little Jimmy”; Yarn/Wire (Kairos)Named for a campsite in California where Andrew McIntosh made field recordings a few months before it was devastated by a fire, “Little Jimmy” (2020) folds those recordings of birds and wind into alternately shimmering and chalk-hard music for piano-percussion quartet. 
1414	The natural world is wondrous, McIntosh suggests, but also stark, lonely and fragile, even threatening. 
1415	ZACHARY WOOLFEMendelssohn: Complete String Quartets, Vol. 
1416	1; Quatuor Van Kuijk (Alpha Classics)The latest Quatuor Van Kuijk recording, the first in a promised survey of Mendelssohn’s string quartets, is, like the group’s previous outings, vigorously and precisely executed, and — without cluttering affect — expressed with refreshing, sometimes revelatory, straightforwardness. 
1417	Particularly in the slow movement of the Op. 12 Quartet in E flat, whose direct phrasing has an irresistibly simple, moving sweetness. 
1418	JOSHUA BARONEMozart: The Piano Sonatas; Robert Levin, fortepiano (ECM)An impossible challenge: Choose a single track from the dozens in Robert Levin’s tirelessly lively, eloquent collection of Mozart’s piano sonatas, recorded on their composer’s own fortepiano. 
1419	But, to pick almost at random, the slow movement from the “Sonata Facile” (K. 545) demonstrates the sensitivity, sustained legato and dashing embellishments that characterize Levin’s whole, sprawling set. 
1420	ZACHARY WOOLFE“From Afar”; Vikingur Ólafsson, piano (Deutsche Grammophon)Vikingur Ólafsson has emerged in his recordings as not only one of the most thoughtful pianists of our time, but also one of the finest arrangers. 
1421	Something of anti-Liszt, he humbly translates the essence of each work, such as in his treatment of Mozart’s “Laudate Dominum,” whose flowing melody over an arpeggiated accompaniment could pass for one of the composer’s delicate sonatas. 
1422	JOSHUA BARONEDora Pejacevic: Piano Concerto and Symphony in F Sharp Minor; BBC Symphony Orchestra; Sakari Oramo, conductor (Chandos)Sakari Oramo has long been a friend to the hardly heard, and it is to his credit that he is now lending his persuasive skills to the effort to bring female composers to greater prominence. 
1423	His righteous advocacy certainly blazes for the Croatian Dora Pejacevic, who died in 1923 at just 37; her bold symphony, finished in 1920, might be in the Dvorakian tradition, but Oramo leaves you in no doubt of its fundamentally adventurous spirit. 
1424	DAVID ALLEN“French Bel Canto Arias”; Lisette Oropesa, soprano; Saxon State Opera Chorus Dresden; Dresden Philharmonic; Corrado Rovaris, conductor (Pentatone)A peerless bel canto interpreter, the soprano Lisette Oropesa combed through her bread-and-butter repertoire to come up with an album’s worth of material in French, her favorite language to sing. 
1425	In this showstopper from Rossini’s elegant comic opera “Le Comte Ory,” Oropesa’s classy singing sneaks subtle flecks of color into fiendish runs taken at the speed of light. 
1426	OUSSAMA ZAHR“Elegie”; Christian Gerhaher, baritone; Basel Chamber Orchestra; Heinz Holliger, conductor (Sony Classical)The baritone Christian Gerhaher mumbles, sighs and occasionally sings full out amid the stark, transfixing musical landscapes of Othmar Schoeck’s orchestral song cycle “Elegie.” “Liebesfrühling” turns the metaphor of spring inside out, locating in its verdancy memories that cause anguish, as Gerhaher’s voice rises to a pained pitch suffused with light. 
1427	OUSSAMA ZAHR“Mein Traum”; Stéphane Degout, baritone; Pygmalion; Raphaël Pichon, conductor (Harmonia Mundi)The conductor Raphaël Pichon’s brilliantly curated album with Pygmalion and the baritone Stéphane Degout, “Mein Traum,” is a marvel of sustained tension in melancholy hues. 
1428	“Der Doppelgänger” exemplifies their shared purpose: Singer and orchestra, breathing as one, crescendo ever so slowly into a climax of uncanny horror. 
1429	OUSSAMA ZAHR“How Do I Find You”; Sasha Cooke, mezzo-soprano; Kirill Kuzmin, piano (Pentatone)The mezzo-soprano Sasha Cooke kicks off her album about the pandemic with the emotional wreckage of the title track by Caroline Shaw. 
1430	Over a simple sequence of diatonic chords, played with compassion by the pianist Kirill Kuzmin, Cooke describes a couple circling their feelings with an amber-toned voice suspended between tears and solace. 
1431	OUSSAMA ZAHR“The Understanding of All Things”; Kate Soper and Sam Pluta (New Focus)In Kate Soper’s playfully searching album, she doesn’t reach some universal understanding. 
1432	Instead, her title track’s fragmented telling of a Kafka story, recounted through vocalise and Laurie Anderson-like elevated speech over the sound of a spinning top, seems to make a statement, but with the syntax of a question. 
1433	Figuring out what to make of that is part of the fun. 
1434	JOSHUA BARONE“Richard Strauss: Three Tone Poems”; Cleveland Orchestra; Franz Welser-Möst, conductor (Cleveland Orchestra)There is no more glorious demonstration than this of what makes the partnership between the Cleveland Orchestra and its music director so special. 
1435	Listen closely to any section of the orchestra, and you will hear playing that is little short of immaculate; draw back to listen to the whole, and you will find Welser-Möst, at his most direct, turn a Strauss piece that most conductors ignore into a minor masterpiece. 
1436	It’s exhilarating. 
1437	DAVID ALLEN“Bernd Alois Zimmermann: Recomposed”; WDR Sinfonieorchester; Heinz Holliger, conductor (Wergo)After World War II, the modernist composer Bernd Alois Zimmermann produced orchestral arrangements of French chansons and Villa-Lobos for West German radio. 
1438	The conductor (and oboist) Holliger has rescued those sparkling adaptations from oblivion. 
1439	Crucially, he also provides fresh looks at Zimmermann originals like “Alagoana,” with its funhouse-mirror reflections of Villa-Lobos (and Milhaud).

1442	DENVER — Nikola Jokic didn’t look like himself in some ways. 
1443	He was missing layups and had been called for a technical foul. 
1444	He made silly turnovers, was late on several defensive rotations and tallied just two assists in the first half.But by the time that game against the Charlotte Hornets was over, Jokic had amassed an eye-popping stat line: 40 points, 27 rebounds and 10 assists. 
1445	It was the first time a player had compiled at least 35 points, 25 rebounds and 10 assists since Wilt Chamberlain did so in 1968 . 
1446	Jokic set a Denver Nuggets record by grabbing 20 rebounds in the first half alone, amid all of his miscues. 
1447	That’s the level Jokic is at nowadays: Even his off games are record-breaking.
1448	“I didn’t know it was a 40, 27 and 10 night,” Nuggets Coach Michael Malone said after the game Sunday. 
1449	“But I knew that he was having just another Nikola Jokic stellar performance.”The next game was Tuesday night against the Memphis Grizzlies, the only team standing between the Nuggets and the best record in the Western Conference. 
1450	Jokic meticulously dismantled Memphis by tossing out 13 assists , feeding his teammates as if he were Mary Poppins among birds, as part of a triple-double in a 14-point win.The almost routine dominance of Jokic — Malone called him “a generational talent” — is bolstering his case to become the first N.B.A. player to win three straight Most Valuable Player Awards since Larry Bird, who won from 1984 to 1986  with the Boston Celtics. 
1451	The only other players to do so were Wilt Chamberlain (1966 to 1968 with the 76ers) and Bill Russell (1961 to 1963 with Boston). 
1452	But it’s not just awards that set Jokic apart from other stars. 
1453	Some players seem to defy the laws of physics with their athleticism. 
1454	Jokic is not fast. 
1455	His vertical is more of a horizontal. 
1456	He isn’t particularly muscular and often looks winded, with his shoulders sagging. 
1457	When he shoots 3-pointers, he slowly winds up and casually flicks his wrist, as if basketball is interrupting his day.Yet Jokic, 27, makes flashy passes look effortless and punishes opponents with brute force at the basket. 
1458	Alex English, a Hall of Famer who won a scoring title for the Nuggets in 1983, said Jokic makes it seem like he “doesn’t have to work so hard.”“His footwork is just unbelievable,” English said. 
1459	“Guys, they don’t know what he’s going to do because he’s got such great footwork. He is just the total package.”Early in the third quarter against Memphis on Tuesday, Jokic caught the ball near the perimeter, instantly tossed the ball between his legs without looking and found a cutting Bruce Brown for a dunk, drawing oohs and aahs  from the crowd. 
1460	That was the amuse-bouche for minutes later, when he coolly tossed a blind over-the-head pass from the low post to Aaron Gordon for another dunk. 
1461	“You just have to be ready for the ball, no matter where you are or where he is on the court because he can find you,” Zeke Nnaji, a third-year reserve forward for the Nuggets, said in the locker room on Sunday.When Jokic is on the court, the Nuggets’ offense is on par with the league’s best teams. 
1462	When he sits, it is the worst, a remarkable swing. 
1463	This year, teammates like Gordon, Brown and guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope are having great years, in part because of the open shots Jokic has created. 
1464	In the case of Brown, roughly half his shots have been “open” or “wide open,” according to the league’s tracking numbers. 
1465	Last year, when Brown was with the Nets, that number was only 38.3 percent . 
1466	One of the most effective plays the Nuggets run involves Jokic catching the ball around the free-throw line, leaving the entire court at his disposal. 
1467	If a double team comes, Jokic casually finds shooters or cutters. 
1468	If he is single-covered, Jokic simply backs down the defender or shoots over him. 
1469	He doesn’t move quickly. 
1470	He gets to where he needs to go, or makes sure the ball does.Jokic, for the third straight season, is leading the league in multiple advanced statistical categories, in large part because of his ruthless efficiency. 
1471	He’s averaging 24.7 points a game, and his true shooting percentage (a measure of scoring efficiency that factors in free throws) — is 68.8 percent. 
1472	No one has ever averaged 20 points per game with at least 69 percent true shooting for a season. 
1473	(During the 1981-82 season, Artis Gilmore averaged 18.5 points a game on 70.2 percent true shooting.)And Jokic does have shortcomings: He’s not a strong defender, even though he’s the only center in the league’s top 20 in steals . 
1474	Opposing teams with quick guards often look to attack him when he’s on defense. 
1475	In the two games this week, Hornets and Grizzlies guards sought Jokic out in transition and stepped right around him for easy layups.His matchup against Memphis guard Ja Morant on Tuesday was a battle in contrasts. 
1476	Morant is a high-flying speedster who seems to have an internal joystick set to turbo at all times. 
1477	Jokic, listed at 6-foot-11, has nine dunks on the year. 
1478	Morant, at 6-foot-2, has 19 . 
1479	Though the Grizzlies lost, Morant’s output was certainly that of a superstar — 35 points and 10 assists — and he, like Jokic, could be in the conversation for the M.V.P. Award.Several players have won twice in a row, including Milwaukee’s Giannis Antetokounmpo immediately before Jokic. 
1480	But few have won the following year, even if, like Jokic, they continued to play well. 
1481	Michael Wilbon, the ESPN broadcaster and longtime M.V.P. voter, said that voter fatigue is “probably” a real factor in voting, though “not consciously.” “You just start to examine your own judgment and you’re saying, ‘Wait a minute, is this person so dominant that he should be installed in this position in a league that has great stars every year?’” Wilbon said. 
1482	Whether Jokic wins again or not is almost besides the point. 
1483	He is one of the best shows to watch — not just in the N.B.A., but in all of professional sports. 
1484	Even though he’s won individual honors, he does not seem to get the attention that other top stars get. 
1485	Maybe it’s because he plays in a smaller market like Denver. 
1486	Maybe it’s because he doesn’t do many commercials and isn’t active on social media. 
1487	Maybe it’s because he hasn’t won a championship. 
1488	But this month will mark only the third time in Jokic’s eight-year career that the N.B.A. will showcase the Nuggets on Christmas, a day the league typically reserves for the league’s marquee players. 
1489	Last year, despite Jokic being the reigning M.V.P., the league snubbed the Nuggets when deciding the holiday’s schedule. 
1490	That’s on the league for depriving viewers of a unicorn: a slow-footed, lumbering big man who manages to awe on a nightly basis in a way no one of his size and physique has before dribbling a basketball.
1491	HALEIWA, Hawaii — Twenty years ago, Keala Kennelly donned a competition jersey and paddled out to the celebrated waves of Pipeline on the North Shore of Oahu, the heart of surfing’s seven-mile mecca. 
1492	It turns out, she was surfing in the future. 
1493	Back then, women surfing Pipeline, a reef break producing huge waves, stuck out like sore thumbs. 
1494	There had been women who took to the break in previous decades — Joyce Hoffman and Jodie Cooper among them — but Kennelly was still one of few. 
1495	There were no major competitions for professional female surfers at Pipeline. 
1496	And Kennelly’s surf wasn’t for a competition either. 
1497	It was for the 2002 film “Blue Crush.” 
1498	In this aspirational reality, a major women’s surf competition was happening at Pipeline. 
1499	Casting directors looked to some of the world’s best female surfers, including Kennelly and Rochelle Ballard, for the roles of a lifetime.
1500	“It had been a dream of mine to have a legit women’s event at Pipeline,” Kennelly said in Honolulu before mid-December’s Vans Pipe Masters tournament. 
1501	“To make a simulated one, it felt real. It’s like I was living my best life. I was living my dream.” 
1502	The dream was too good to be true at the time. 
1503	It would take almost two decades for Kennelly and Ballard to witness the event they had portrayed happen in reality. 
1504	But twice this year, they watched a group of female athletes compete at the highest level in the waves of Pipeline. 
1505	And it wasn’t for a movie.The evolution in the surfing world comes amid a wave of progress in women’s sports at the highest levels. 
1506	In 2019, the World Surf League, surfing’s organizing body, began awarding equal prize money to its men’s and women’s athletes. 
1507	In 2020, the W.N.B.A. and its players union agreed on a collective bargaining agreement that increased salaries and provided new maternity benefits. 
1508	In May, U.S. Soccer and its top men’s and women’s players  agreed to landmark deals that guaranteed equal pay and shared World Cup prize money. 
1509	But look no further than the surf break that attracts the attention of the entire surfing world to see how deep an opportunity gap can still run in a sport moving toward equality. 
1510	“If I had known it would take a half century to get a contest at Pipe or pay parity, I probably would have given up,” said Patti Paniccia, one of the founders of the professional surfing tour in 1976. 
1511	Paniccia, 70, has spent much of her life fighting for acknowledgment, if not equality, in the world’s best waves.If a surf contest were run in the same location for men and women, Paniccia said, the men’s competition would run in the best wave conditions. 
1512	The women’s contest would be relegated to what Paniccia called “the slop.” 
1513	And while there have been a handful of women’s amateur contests and invitationals held at Pipeline since 2005, surfers issue a quick addendum. 
1514	There’s surfing Pipeline, surfers unanimously explain, and then there’s surfing “real Pipeline.” 
1515	When the waves are breaking just right, the water can hike up like a two-story building some 50 yards from the shore over sharp, shallow reef. 
1516	Catching a wave in those conditions can change a life, or destroy one. 
1517	But there’s a Catch-22 of looking at equity of women’s surfing through a break like Pipeline. 
1518	To master certain waves — especially powerful, technical waves — surfers need to spend a significant amount of time training in those spots. 
1519	Pipeline is not learned in a few sessions. 
1520	And since the women’s professional surfing tour has not included a contest at Pipeline, many top surfers simply did not prioritize training there. 
1521	The wave is of great ancestral importance to Native Hawaiians, and respect must be paid and earned. 
1522	When paddling out to Pipeline, surfers need to understand the nuances in the environment and their place in it, especially when there are some 100 to 150 of the world’s best barrel riders looking to catch the same perfect wave. 
1523	Generations of women have heard the question thrown around the beach. 
1524	Could girls compete at Pipe? 
1525	They wanted to be ready to answer the question in competition unequivocally, when all eyes would be on them. 
1526	Kennelly, a former top surfer on the world tour and one of the world’s top female big-wave surfers, has experience being one of the few women in waves of consequence. 
1527	She had seen how “Blue Crush” sent shock waves across a surf industry that had previously catered to men. 
1528	But she had also seen a lack of progress, and a laundry list of events that did not include women. 
1529	And she still wanted to see a major event at Pipeline.In July 2016, Kennelly co-founded the Committee for Equity in Women’s Surfing with other professional big-wave surfers. 
1530	They explored how local governments could help them in their fight to equalize the sport , and they successfully lobbied California state officials to support the inclusion of a woman’s competition in the big-wave Mavericks surf event.In late 2019, Kennelly turned her focus to Hawaii. 
1531	If the wheels of progress were already in motion toward an event at Pipeline, the encouragement of local government couldn’t hurt. 
1532	In January 2020, the Honolulu City Council unanimously voted to approve a resolution that supported gender equity  in professional surfing. 
1533	“It takes a lot of minor, small, minute shifts for progress to really happen,” said Tyler Wright, a two-time world champion from Australia, in an interview on the shores of Pipeline. 
1534	As Wright, who has spent much of her life at the top of the sport, discussed what equality could look like in professional surfing, she stopped short, distracted by two men who appeared to be stuck in a current. 
1535	“One sec,” she said. 
1536	The 28-year-old Wright grabbed a surfboard and ran some 50 meters to the ocean. 
1537	North Shore lifeguards  were right behind her, and the men were safely on land within minutes. 
1538	“Sorry about that,” she said as she returned. 
1539	Where were we. 
1540	Oh, yes — a women’s place at Pipeline.
1541	“My view of the overall picture is that women’s equality takes a long time because we’re only getting the investment today,” she said. 
1542	Indeed, men have competed at Pipeline since an inaugural contest was held in 1971. 
1543	“Give us 50 years of insane money and equality and access and value and inclusive lineups, and you’ll have a pretty similar product.”In December 2020, after a fatal shark incident involving a recreational surfer at Honolua Bay, Maui, the World Surf League moved its women’s year-end championship tour event to Pipeline. 
1544	The historic move would soon become part of the regular schedule. 
1545	Wright became the first woman to win a championship tour event at Pipeline, defeating the Hawaiian Carissa Moore  in the final heat. 
1546	It was a defining moment for Jessi Miley-Dyer, the chief of sport at the World Surf League. 
1547	“After that competition, I knew that we had to have women at Pipeline,” she said. 
1548	Miley-Dyer, a former professional surfer on the world tour, said the organization had been rebuilding the women’s tour since new ownership took over in 2013. 
1549	“For a lot of people who were watching, and the crew on the beach, it was so emotional to see that come to fruition when you have been looking at it and wanting it for such a long time,” Miley-Dyer said.This year, the World Surf League began hosting its championship tour  at the same spots for men and women. 
1550	Wright has already seen an increase in women paddling out to Pipeline. 
1551	“All that matters is the next generation who are 12 and 5 now see themselves in this lineup,” she said. 
1552	Like Kennelly and Wright and countless other surfers before her, Moana Jones Wong long dreamed of Pipeline as a young girl. 
1553	But she didn’t just dream about surfing it: She wanted to be the first woman to win a proper Pipeline tournament. 
1554	Jones Wong, a 23-year-old North Shore native, describes Pipeline as a character, one that can sense pompous surfers a mile away and quickly introduce them to humility through the reef below the surface. 
1555	Jones Wong speaks like a veteran who has studied the break in and out of the water for much of her life. 
1556	That’s because she has. 
1557	Jones Wong first paddled out when she was 12 years old, battling thoughts that it was “a man’s wave.” 
1558	She was a talented young surfer, and her friends — boys around her age — encouraged her to join them. 
1559	It still was not easy.
1560	“I had this social judgment, like I shouldn’t be out at Pipeline because I’m a girl,” she said. 
1561	“It would prevent me from going out a lot.”She was so drawn to the wave that she would push herself out of her comfort zone, she said, recalling telling herself, “I’m not going to let this social norm that I’m feeling from everybody prevent me from surfing the wave I want to surf.” 
1562	It would take her six years to catch a wave that made her feel like she truly belonged out there.In February, Jones Wong became the first woman to win the Billabong Pro Pipeline , defeating both Wright and the newly minted Olympic gold medalist Moore.Kennelly, who said she was not a crier, watched with tears in her eyes. 
1563	She had been nervous. 
1564	She knew there would be an acclimation process. 
1565	“I needed them to justify what I had done to get them in there — I really needed them to come through,” she said. 
1566	“And I feel like they did.” 
1567	This month, the top men and women returned to the North Shore for the Vans Pipe Masters event. 
1568	The significance of what was happening offshore was not lost onshore.After Moore rode what might have been the best wave of the event , the beach erupted in pandemonium before the heat was even over. 
1569	It was a qualifying round, but no matter. 
1570	This — the women’s competition at “real” Pipeline — was the main event. 
1571	On Dec. 18, Moore, 30, surfed in the finals and was joined by the next generation: 20-year-old Molly Picklum and two 17-year-olds, Bettylou Sakura Johnson and Caity Simmers. 
1572	Picklum won the event, and she was wide-eyed as a gaggle of young girls waited for her autograph.
1573	“All the girls sitting here realizing that Pipe is on the cards for women’s surfing is incredible,” Picklum said, trophy in hand. 
1574	“And I think women’s surfing is only going up really quickly from here.”
1575	Since Elon Musk bought Twitter in October, the self-proclaimed “free speech absolutist” has ad-libbed his way through the company’s moderation policies.He initially argued that bans should be reserved for spam accounts, offering “amnesty” to thousands of suspended users and reinstating former president Donald J. Trump. 
1576	Last week, he suspended several journalists, claiming they had shared public flight data revealing his private location. 
1577	(Many of the bans were later reversed.)To gauge how Mr. Musk’s content decisions influenced Twitter’s content, The New York Times analyzed tweets from more than 1,000 users whose accounts were recently reinstated. 
1578	The posts were collected for The Times by Bright Data , a social media tracking company, using a list of reinstated users identified by Travis Brown, a Berlin-based software developer who has tracked extremism on Twitter. 
1579	Most of the reinstated accounts were deeply partisan — often vocal supporters of Mr. Trump — and they appeared eager to bring their fiery takes back to the social network. 
1580	It was not clear from the data why the users were originally suspended or why they were reinstated, though their post histories suggest many were banned as Twitter cracked down on Covid-19 and election-related misinformation.Imran Ahmed, the founder and chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, said the message Mr. Musk sent to the formerly suspended users was clear: “‘Welcome back, welcome home.” 
1581	Twitter and Mr. Musk did not respond to a request for comment.
1582	“I finally got this account back after being banned for being a #Republican thanks @elonmusk,” one user tweeted. 
1583	Just 10 minutes later, the same person wrote: “Joe Biden is an illegitimate president and the 2020 election was stolen.” 
1584	Here is some of what these users have been saying on Twitter since their return.During the pandemic, Twitter introduced a policy that banned misinformation about the virus, suspending over 11,000 accounts, including many prominent users, after they pushed falsehoods. 
1585	But in November of this year, after Mr. Musk took control of the company, Twitter said that it would no longer enforce that policy . 
1586	Several reinstated users who were banned after the Covid-19 policies went into effect started posting again about the virus and its vaccines. 
1587	Some raised doubts about the effectiveness of vaccines or suggested, without evidence, that vaccines kill people. 
1588	Several posts mentioned “Died Suddenly,” a misleading documentary released this year that claimed people were dying from the vaccine. 
1589	Others shared their own unsupported anecdotes. 
1590	“If you watched ‘Died Suddenly’ here is more confirming evidence,” one user tweeted, adding a link to a website titled “Covid Jab Side Effects.” 
1591	Before being banned in January 2021, the user had posted several times about Covid-19, including posts that the virus was not dangerous.Twitter cracked down on election fraud conspiracy theories after the 2020 election, suspending thousands of accounts  that pushed false and misleading ideas about the election results. 
1592	Hundreds of users have since returned to Twitter, pushing those ideas once again. 
1593	Many reinstated users focused on close races in the midterm elections, including the governor’s race in Arizona and the Senate race in Pennsylvania. 
1594	Kari Lake, the Republican candidate for governor in Arizona, lost her race but has refused to concede, citing problems with the voting process and claiming fraud. 
1595	Many reinstated users echoed her ideas. 
1596	Those tweets recycled falsehoods and conspiracy theories from the 2020 election, including that voting machines were rigged to influence the outcome.
1597	“Voters, not voting machines, used to decide elections in Arizona,” one reinstated user tweeted. 
1598	“That’s no longer the case.”QAnon, the online conspiracy theory, appeared to reach its peak on Jan. 6, 2021, when hundreds of Mr. Trump’s supporters stormed the Capitol Building. 
1599	Twitter suspended over 70,000 accounts  linked to the group afterward. 
1600	But many of the movement’s core ideas have continued playing a significant role in the far-right imagination. 
1601	On Twitter, reinstated users have returned to familiar themes in QAnon lore, raising questions about prominent Democrats and their association with Jeffrey Epstein, a former financier who was charged with child sex trafficking and is a central figure in QAnon conspiracies. 
1602	They have claimed without evidence that Democrats and Hollywood personalities are engaged in widespread sex trafficking and pedophilia. 
1603	And they have also repeated claims that liberals are “grooming” children using drag performances and sex education.
1604	“I just was reinstated today after 2 years of permanent suspension,” wrote one reinstated user with “QAnon” in his user name. 
1605	“I guess I owe that to the new owner thank you Elon Musk.”
1606	The proliferation of documentaries on streaming services makes it difficult to choose what to watch. 
1607	Each month, we’ll choose three nonfiction films — classics, overlooked recent docs and more — that will reward your time. 
1608	Stream it on Netflix.When the documentarian Julia Reichert (“American Factory”) died earlier this month, her obituary  in The New York Times called “A Lion in the House” her most personal film. 
1609	Directed with her husband and filmmaking partner, Steven Bognar, the documentary began when, according to Bognar’s opening narration, they were invited by the head oncologist at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital to make a documentary about what a family goes through when a child has cancer. 
1610	In the voice-over, Reichert notes that their own daughter had just finished treatment for cancer. 
1611	After the movie was finished, Reichert received a diagnosis of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.Made over six years, the documentary pivots around 5A, the cancer unit at the pediatric hospital. 
1612	For nearly four hours of screen time, it immerses viewers in the lives of five patients who received their cancer diagnoses as children, and in the lives of their families and the many doctors, nurses and social workers charged with their care. 
1613	While a film like Frederick Wiseman’s extraordinary “Near Death” (1989)  approached the subject of mortality with intimacy but a characteristic detachment, “A Lion in the House” is a case in which the filmmakers have a clear emotional investment in the material. 
1614	Few documentaries look so unflinchingly yet so compassionately at the cruelty of relentless medical ordeals. 
1615	The patients vary in their circumstances and prognoses. 
1616	They include Tim, a teenager with Hodgkin’s lymphoma, who initially resists his doctors’ efforts to have him gain weight and whose illness has severely limited his social life and his attendance at school. 
1617	Alex, who has leukemia, is introduced when she is 7 and her cancer is in remission, but it returns, and Reichert and Bognar follow her and her at-times disagreeing parents through a succession of tough decisions on treatment, in which the answers about what’s best for Alex and what ‌might prolong her survival are not always clear. 
1618	Justin, at 19, has already been fighting leukemia for 10 years when the movie begins; over the course of the film, he reaches what appears to be the end, with at least one doctor pushing for a serious discussion about his death. 
1619	But when Justin somehow survives after 24 hours of having what another doctor calls “blood pressures incompatible with life,” the parents’ decision on whether to press on for their professed fighter of a son only grows thornier. 
1620	Every moment in the movie is the stuff of life and death, and while “A Lion in the House” is almost always tough to watch, it is also impossible to shake.Stream it on Fandor, Kanopy, Ovid, Projectr and Topic. 
1621	Rent it on Amazon and Apple TV . 
1622	The protests following the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the killing of Trayvon Martin prompted the experimental filmmaker Travis Wilkerson to investigate a troubling family story. 
1623	He had been told S.E. Branch, his great-grandfather, who ran a grocery store in Dothan, Ala., and was, from what we hear of him, a virulent racist, had killed a Black man, Bill Spann, in the 1940s and gotten away with it. 
1624	Wilkerson’s mother quickly sends him a newspaper item from 1946; it says that there was a charge against Branch for first-degree murder in Spann’s killing. 
1625	But that charge mysteriously disappeared, as tended to happen when white men committed violence against Black people in the Deep South, and Branch went on to live for decades. 
1626	Wilkerson pores images of him in eight-millimeter home movies, one of which is labeled with the month of the murder. 
1627	He even has a photo of the two of them together, the year Wilkerson was born and Branch died. 
1628	As for Spann, there are few traces left of him or any descendants. 
1629	“Did You Wonder Who Fired the Gun?” is partly the filmmaker’s effort to atone for that absence. 
1630	To paraphrase his voice-over, this is the story of a murder victim buried in an unmarked grave — and of the killer’s great-grandson, who is filming that grave. 
1631	“That’s a pretty precise expression of racism, no matter how you cut it,” Wilkerson narrates. 
1632	The scope of this chilling essay film is much broader than Wilkerson’s family history and his sleuthing. 
1633	Wilkerson meets with Edward Vaughn, a civil rights activist from the area who remembers a boycott of Branch’s grocery store after the killing and the woeful conditions at the hospital where Spann had been taken. 
1634	Wilkerson weaves in an account of the rape of Recy Taylor — an assault that took place nearby in 1944 — and the work that Rosa Parks, roughly a decade before the Montgomery Bus Boycott, did to investigate it.

1636	“Flee,” from the director Jonas Poher Rasmussen, received Oscar nominations for both animated feature and documentary — an unusual combination. 
1637	But animation really is the ideal form for this nonfiction account of one refugee’s flight from Afghanistan in the early 1990s. 
1638	One of the themes that emerges is that living clandestinely requires continually being able to adapt one’s identity. 
1639	In that way, the abstraction of animation — its distance from reality — reflects the material. 
1640	The central figure of “Flee” is called Amin in the film (at the start, the documentary notes that certain names and locations have been altered to protect the subjects). 
1641	He knew Rasmussen from high school, but there is a lot that Rasmussen did not know about him. 
1642	As Amin’s interlocutor throughout the feature, the director, interviewing him in Copenhagen, gets him to divulge things that he has largely kept to himself, for understandable reasons. 
1643	Amin gives an account of a journey from Afghanistan that was anything but straightforward: He speaks of arriving in Moscow the year after the fall of the Soviet Union and an arduous effort to escape that eventually returned him to Russia, for a time. 
1644	You might be tempted to see Amin’s resilience as inspiring, but in “Flee,” he also considers the lingering effects his experiences on the run have had on his personality. 
1645	“When you flee as a child, it takes time to learn to trust people,” he says. 
1646	“You’re constantly on your guard.” 
1647	The sense given is that his defensive mode may have even caused friction in his present relationship. 
1648	The film also deals with Amin’s coming to terms with being gay — he says there wasn’t even a word for it in Afghanistan — and his fears of his family’s reaction. 
1649	But that outpouring — more of a blurting-out — makes for one of the film’s most unexpected and heartwarming sequences.
1650	ByteDance, the China-based parent company of TikTok, said on Thursday that an internal investigation found that employees had inappropriately obtained the data of U.S. TikTok users, including two reporters. 
1651	Over the summer, a few employees on a ByteDance team responsible for monitoring employee conduct tried to find the sources of suspected leaks of internal conversations and business documents to journalists. 
1652	In doing so, the employees gained access to the IP addresses and other data of two reporters and a small number of people connected to the reporters via their TikTok accounts. 
1653	They were trying to determine if those individuals were in the same proximity of ByteDance employees, according to the company, which added that the efforts failed to find any leaks.The investigation was initiated after an article was published by Forbes, and the inquiry confirms part of that report and acknowledges the privacy and security risks  associated with TikTok that U.S. lawmakers, state governors and the Trump and Biden administrations have raised for more than two years. 
1654	More than a dozen states have banned TikTok from government-issued devices, and the company has been in prolonged negotiations with the administration on security and privacy measures that would block any potential access of U.S. user data by ByteDance and the Chinese government. 
1655	ByteDance’s general counsel, Erich Andersen, revealed the findings of the investigation, which was conducted by an outside law firm, in an email to employees on Thursday. 
1656	One person on the team resigned and three were fired. 
1657	Two of those employees were based in China and two were in the United States. 
1658	ByteDance said it has restructured its global compliance team and has removed any access to U.S. data from that department. 
1659	The targeted reporters wrote for BuzzFeed and The Financial Times, ByteDance said, though it declined to identify them and other affected TikTok users. 
1660	Mr. Andersen and ByteDance’s chief executive, Rubo Liang, revealed the findings of the investigation in separate emails to employees.
1661	“I was deeply disappointed when I was notified of the situation. . . and I’m sure you feel the same,” Mr. Liang wrote. 
1662	“The public trust that we have spent huge efforts building is going to be significantly undermined by the misconduct of a few individuals.” 
1663	The chief executive of TikTok, Shou Zi Chew, also sent an email to his employees about the investigation, expressing disappointment and stressing the company’s commitment to protect U.S. data.
1664	“We take data security incredibly seriously,” Mr. Chew said in the email. 
1665	He said that over the past 15 months, the company had worked to create a new U.S.-based data storage program as a “testament to that commitment.”The revelations come amid growing concerns by U.S. officials  about the privacy and national security risks posed by TikTok, a hugely popular video-sharing app with an estimated 100 million American users. 
1666	ByteDance acquired TikTok, formerly known as Musical.ly, in 2017 and has since been the focus of national security officials who say the app is too closely aligned with its parent company in China and can put sensitive data, such as geolocation and the habits and interests of users in the United States, into the hands of the Chinese government. 
1667	In the hopes of allying national security fears, ByteDance has moved the data of U.S. users to a cloud storage system operated by Oracle, the Silicon Valley software company.In September, TikTok’s chief operating officer, Vanessa Pappas, testified in a Senate hearing  that the app did not share data with the Chinese government. 
1668	The company has tried to distance the app from ByteDance, saying TikTok has its own corporate structure, with offices in Washington, Singapore, New York and Los Angeles. 
1669	TikTok has been locked in negotiations with the Biden administration on a data security plan that would put all U.S. data on Oracle’s cloud servers and erect walls around that data to prevent access by the Chinese government. 
1670	The negotiations, which began during the Trump administration, have stalled in recent weeks, prompting a cascade of state and federal actions to restrict the use of TikTok.Congress is set to vote as early as this week on a proposal that would ban TikTok from any federal devices. 
1671	Intelligence officials, including the F.B.I. director Christopher Wray , has warned that Chinese officials can siphon sensitive data about U.S. citizens to use for surveillance and to spread propaganda. 
1672	TikTok is in the middle of an escalating economic and trade war between the United States and China for technology leadership. 
1673	The superpowers have imposed trade restrictions on foreign-made technologies and have poured hundreds of billions of dollars into subsidies and grants to bring back tech supply chains for manufacturing within their borders. 
1674	A bill by Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, would ban TikTok on all federal devices, in the farthest-reaching restriction of the app yet. 
1675	He said that despite assurances by ByteDance and TikTok, the Chinese government has broad powers of data collection, including of U.S. users of apps connected to Chinese companies.
1676	“TikTok is essentially a back door for the Communist Party to track keystrokes, contact lists and location, and there is no way to turn it off,” Mr. Hawley said in an interview this week. 
1677	“Under Chinese law, ByteDance is obligated to turn over data and that is a major privacy risk for Americans.”
1678	Jennifer McClellan, a Virginia state senator, won a Democratic primary in a special House election in the state’s Fourth Congressional District, according to the local Democratic Party. 
1679	The victory early Wednesday puts her on a path to become the first Black woman to represent Virginia in Congress.The special election, to fill the seat held by Representative A. Donald McEachin  until his death late last month, is scheduled for Feb. 21. 
1680	Mr. McEachin, a Democrat, overwhelmingly won re-election in the midterms, but died weeks later at the age of 61 after a yearslong battle with colorectal cancer. 
1681	Because the district leans Democratic — it is a predominantly Black and Latino region that stretches from Richmond into rural counties along the North Carolina border — Ms. McClellan is highly favored to win in February. 
1682	She will face Leon Benjamin, a Republican and local pastor.  
1683	Ms. McClellan, whose State Senate district largely overlaps with that of the House seat she is seeking, ran unsuccessfully for governor last year in a crowded primary field, but the effort elevated her statewide profile. 
1684	She won the special primary with nearly 85 percent of the 27,900 votes cast , according to the state’s Democratic Party. 
1685	In the final days of the one-week primary campaign, an overwhelming majority of Virginia Democrats coalesced around Ms. McClellan’s candidacy. 
1686	All eight members of Virginia’s Democratic congressional delegation threw their support behind her, as did scores of state lawmakers and several national groups supporting women and candidates of color.  
1687	Ms. McClellan centered her message on her Virginia roots and legislative accomplishments. 
1688	In an interview on Friday, she said being a Black woman had helped shape her policies, particularly on workers’ rights and maternal health.Her top Democratic rival was State Senator Joe Morrissey, a self-described rebel within the party. 
1689	Mr. Morrissey, a former defense lawyer, was disbarred twice and spent time in jail for aiding the delinquency of a minor in 2014. 
1690	The minor involved later became his wife. 
1691	In January 2022, then-Gov. 
1692	Ralph Northam pardoned Mr. Morrissey  for his conviction in the case. 
1693	Mr. Morrissey has voted against Democratic policies and has signaled his opposition to proposed state policies protecting abortion access.
1694	It’s been popular in Washington in recent years to lament Congress’s declining oversight powers, and with good reason. 
1695	Donald Trump used lawsuits and new levels of stonewalling to effectively thwart myriad inquiries by House Democrats. 
1696	He left office having successfully shielded his tax returns and survived two impeachments. 
1697	Yet in the waning days of Democrats’ House majority, it is becoming clear that assessment needs updating. 
1698	After years of grinding, some of Congress’s efforts to shine light in the darker corners of the Trump presidency have turned out to be remarkably productive. 
1699	Just this week, a House committee took steps to reveal tax returns that Trump refused to release, after a yearslong fight that went all the way to the Supreme Court. 
1700	In the coming days, the public will be able to read documents for themselves that are almost certain to further undercut the image of financial prosperity that the former president has sought to fashion. 
1701	And today, the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol plans to wrap up arguably the deepest congressional investigation in decades. 
1702	Its investigators broke into Trump’s inner circle, broadcast damning testimony to tens of millions of Americans and are turning over reams of evidence to federal prosecutors. 
1703	Of course, this timing is not what Democrats initially hoped for when they swept into the House majority four years ago and pledged to conduct deep oversight of the Trump administration. 
1704	And Republicans have attacked the recent investigations as abuses — not successes — of Congress’s investigative powers. 
1705	Those House Republicans are now preparing to begin their own inquiries into the Biden administration next year. 
1706	The Biden White House will almost certainly try to slow them down, an executive branch maneuver that predates the Trump administration. 
1707	But Democrats’ 11th-hour oversight wins suggest that if Congress is willing to go to court, apply creative pressure and wait, its fact-finding function can still deliver results. 
1708	In some cases, those results can prompt reforms. 
1709	And in the end, Americans end up better informed about their government. 
1710	The struggle over Trump’s tax returns stretches back to his first presidential campaign, which began in 2015. 
1711	He defied historical norms and refused to make public the documents. 
1712	Once they took over the House majority in 2019, Democrats requested the returns from the I.R.S. ostensibly to assess the agency’s mandatory presidential audit program, setting off a fight to get them. 
1713	The key to Democrats’ ultimate victory — delivered by the Supreme Court last month — was their willingness to commit to years of court fights (and holding on to their House majority in 2020). 
1714	On Tuesday, Democrats voted to begin releasing thousands of pages of Trump’s personal and business tax records in the coming days. 
1715	Republicans objected on privacy grounds and warned that the disclosure would set a dangerous precedent.Here are the highlights so far, based on a summary congressional report: Despite the program that requires audits of sitting presidents, the I.R.S. failed to audit Trump  during the first two years of his presidency. 
1716	It began auditing returns from those years only after he left office. 
1717	Those audits are still going on. 
1718	Democrats are now pushing for a government watchdog to investigate and contemplating reforms to the audit program.Trump paid $1.1 million in federal income taxes  in his first three years as president. 
1719	But in 2020, as the Covid pandemic gripped the country, he reported a $4.8 million loss and paid zero income tax.The documents added new information to reporting in The New York Times  that shows he aggressively used chronic losses to avoid paying taxes, despite taking in hundreds of millions of dollars a year. 
1720	The Jan. 6 committee took direct aim at Trump this week in the finale to its own 18-month investigation. 
1721	The panel voted on Monday to recommend that the Justice Department prosecute the former president for a range of crimes related to his attempt to overturn the 2020 election. 
1722	Today it plans to release an 800-plus-page final report documenting that scheme in vivid detail. 
1723	While investigators in other high-profile Trump-era congressional inquiries struggled to secure witnesses, the Jan. 6 team worked with more than 1,000 and left few major questions unanswered. 
1724	The witnesses included senior members of the administration, G.O.P. officials and other Republicans who were freer to talk after Trump left office or were motivated by the threat of legal action or by a disgust with his actions. 
1725	It also helped that the committee did not include Republican members hostile to its mission who may have tried to undermine its work.The I.R.S. didn’t audit Trump in his first years in office, but it subjected both President Barack Obama and President Biden to annual audits . 
1726	Trump had an adjusted gross income of $15.8 million in his first three years in office.

1769	One Monday in late November, preservationists, politicians, neighbors and looky-loos gathered at dusk on Manhattan’s tiny Gay Street, a slim crescent in the heart of Greenwich Village, to protest the demolition of a nearly 200-year-old house there. 
1770	The place in question, 14 Gay Street, is one of a clutch of six winsome but precarious early 19th-century buildings on Gay and Christopher Streets that were owned for decades by Celeste Martin, a singular character devoted to her properties and to the often eccentric cast of tenants she nurtured. 
1771	Ms. Martin died in late 2018, at 94, with no will and no close relatives, so the city took over her holdings, selling 14 Gay Street and its siblings for about $9 million to a buyer who flipped them last April to Lionel Nazarian, a 37-year-old developer, for about $12 million. 
1772	Since then, Mr. Nazarian has done foundation work that has destabilized 14 Gay Street and imperiled its neighbors, so the city has ordered its demolition, a slow, laborious process that began just before Thanksgiving. 
1773	Chillingly, this scenario is one that is playing out all over the city, said Andrew Berman, the executive director of Village Preservation and the organizer of the November protest: As developers have been buying up vulnerable landmark properties, they are either allowing them to deteriorate or doing work that compromises public safety. 
1774	In the last year, he said, more than a dozen such buildings have come down.Mr. 
1775	Berman blames the lack of oversight and coordination by city agencies. 
1776	“As a result,” he said, “our neighborhoods are paying the price, our city’s history and heritage are paying the price, and the irreplaceable historic landmarks that distinguish New York from everywhere else are being lost.” 
1777	The city, along with the Landmarks Preservation Commission, said in a statement it had approved plans for the work on Gay Street and that Mr. Nazarian’s construction crew did not follow their instructions. 
1778	Preservationists like Mr. Berman and local politicians like Deborah Glick have cried foul, declaring that the city and the commission should have been overseeing the work and described Mr. Nazarian as a bad actor. 
1779	In 2017, he was accused of creating hazardous conditions and tenant harassment in a property he owns in the East Village. 
1780	Mr. Berman wondered if his actions were deliberate, to insure he wouldn’t have to restore his new holdings, but be allowed to tear them down and start fresh. 
1781	For his part, Mr. Nazarian said the construction workers made a terrible mistake, adding that he loves historic architecture and just wants to preserve the buildings.The doughty but fragile antique buildings that Ms. Martin left behind “are part of this incredible surviving collection of very early houses,” said Andrew S. Dolkart, a professor of historic preservation at the Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation. 
1782	“Dozens were built in the 1820s, but not many are left — certainly not in groups on a small, intimate street. They are really precious.”The building at 14 Gay Street dates to 1827; its siblings, a year later. 
1783	“They were originally built for the mercantile class,” Mr. Dolkart said. 
1784	“They weren’t built for the wealthy. They aren’t pristine museum pieces: You can see they had lived, and been lived in, over time.”That’s significant, because the early 19th century was the last period “that modest people, shop owners and small business owners, could afford to live in a single-family home in a built-up section of Manhattan,” he continued. 
1785	“You can still see a number of these houses peppering the Village.” 
1786	By the end of the century, many had evolved into boardinghouses and multifamily dwellings. 
1787	By then, Gay Street was an integrated block, with a large Black community and a melting pot of immigrants from Ireland, Denmark, France, Italy, Germany and Belgium.All six buildings are landmarked — Gay Street is in the Village’s historic district — but No. 14 is especially noteworthy as a literary artifact, the onetime home of Ruth McKenney , who memorialized her dodgy subterranean apartment there in “My Sister Eileen,” a collection of stories about her adventures as a young writer in the city that was published in 1938 and inspired the fizzy early 1950s musical “Wonderful Town,” with lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green and music by Leonard Bernstein. 
1788	(For years, a longtime tenant of the apartment, David Ryan, was awakened by tourists belting the refrain of the musical’s signature number, “Why, oh why, oh why-oh/Why did I ever leave Ohio?” and peering through the bars of his bedroom window. When the play was revived on Broadway in 2003, he suffered acutely.) 
1789	Ms. Martin’s father, Edmond, who was French, bought the six buildings that now belong to Mr. Nazarian in the 1920s, along with several other properties in the Village, including a fanciful pink Moorish-looking townhouse on Waverly Place, where Ms. Martin grew up. 
1790	While his father wanted him to join the family’s sail-making business, Edmond fancied himself a real estate mogul and an artist. 
1791	With the help of his wife, Ramee, he turned the Gay and Christopher Street buildings into a complex of furnished studio apartments, decorated by Ramee and outfitted with slipcovers and curtains sewn by their nanny.In her short story “Mr. Spitzer and the Fungus,” Ms. McKenney renders Edmond as a pompous landlord with artistic pretensions — his character was called Mr. Appopolous in the musical — and her $45 a month basement flat, where she lived with her sister, Eileen, as a dimly lit dump sprouting with mold, including a particularly aggressive fungus that draped from the ceiling. 
1792	“Every night we cut it down with Eileen’s manicure scissors,” she wrote, “and every morning it was long enough to braid. Eileen thought there was something shameful about the fungus, and she always carefully cut it down before we had a party.” 
1793	Edmond was said to have been miffed by his portrayal in Ms. McKenney’s work; he felt his artistic talents weren’t appropriately recognized. 
1794	He was not a bad painter, said Matt McGhee, who for decades sold exquisite Christmas ornaments out of his fairyland boutique at 18 Christopher and lived in a one-bedroom next door. 
1795	Notably, though, Edmond was a racist, cited by the city for refusing to rent to Black people. 
1796	At one point, he hung a sign in his office at 16 Gay Street declaring this policy. 
1797	In 1959, The Daily News reported, he filed a suit against the city, claiming that its anti-discrimination housing law interfered with his “aesthetic freedom.” 
1798	Needless to say, he did not prevail. 
1799	When he died in 1985, Ms. Martin inherited his properties, but not his bigotry. 
1800	However, she was never the most assiduous steward of the houses. 
1801	As Jeanne Kelly, the former director of fossil preparations at the American Museum of Natural History and a Gay Street neighbor for two decades, put it, they were held together with spit and a prayer, and the haphazard ministrations of a retinue of helpers that at one point included a super who was blind and a physics teacher with a number of aliases.But Ms. Martin was generous to her tenants, offering to waive rent if they were in extremis and delivering Christmas gifts of pink Champagne and sweets. 
1802	(One year, Mr. McGhee said, the gifts included stuffed animals; he received a dog.)She doted on many of the tenants, but Mr. Ryan, who moved into the McKenney apartment in the early 1970s and decorated it with distinctive, decaying élan, English country style, was a favorite. 
1803	When “Wonderful Town” was in revival on Broadway in December of 2003, they saw the musical together. 
1804	A few weeks later, on Christmas Eve, Mr. Ryan died in a fire that consumed his apartment , and Ms. Martin never quite recovered. 
1805	Instead of renovating the apartment, neighbors said, she left it to rot and to the rats. 
1806	“It was the beginning of her decline,” Ms. Kelly said.Since 1976, Denise Marsa, a singer-songwriter,  has lived in her tidy studio around the corner, in the building Ms. Martin once owned at 18 Christopher Street. 
1807	(She can still remember the original rent: $174.24.). 
1808	She tried to help Ms. Martin in her final years, urging her to make a will, but her landlord “lived in a fairy tale,” she said.Today, Ms. Marsa, 68, is the last residential tenant in the building, her cheerful apartment, with its kitchen tucked into a closet, an object lesson in small-space living and the promise of studio life as a launching pad. 
1809	She, too, has rendered her home in song, as Comden and Green once did, in a number featured in “The Pass,” her one-woman show about making it in the big city, which she performed at United Solo, a theater festival in Manhattan, in the fall of 2021. 
1810	(The storefronts below her are full; John Derian, the purveyor of his own brand of charming decay, took over the spot occupied by Mr. McGhee four years ago.)Back at the rally organized by Mr. Berman, the mood was festive, despite everything. 
1811	The growl of a bulldozer interrupted the protesters. 
1812	Its driver, a private contractor, said he was there to do work under the road in front of 14 Gay Street. 
1813	When questioned, he said he did not know who had hired him, and beat a retreat. 
1814	Across the street, Joan Goldberg, a broker with Brown Harris Stevens, was holding a quasi-open house at 13 Gay Street, a modest Greek Revival built around 1840 and owned by Margaret Kunstler, the widow of the civil rights lawyer William Kunstler, who died in 1995 and was known for representing some controversial clients. 
1815	(The house is on the market for $6.9 million.)“It was a wonderful street to live on,” Ms. Kunstler said. 
1816	“We had big Halloweens. Sometimes we would shut down the street for birthday parties. The house was open; there were constant comings and goings.” 
1817	These days, from the top floor of Ms. Kunstler’s house, you can see into the dark cavity that is all that’s left of where Ruth and Eileen McKenney once lived: two gaping window frames braced by wooden beams. 
1818	Representatives from the Landmarks Preservation Commission and the city said that the city will be taking action against Mr. Nazarian for what they say was illegal work done there. 
1819	Furthermore, the city is requiring that the demolition of 14 Gay Street be done by hand and its material saved for use in a reconstruction that the city and the Landmarks Preservation Commission will oversee. 
1820	“I never intended to just let them rot,” Mr. Nazarian said of the buildings.Asked to estimate what it might cost to restore them, he said, “More than I thought.”For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here .
1821	By their very nature, awards shows are designed to exclude, barring all but a few from the glory of earning a nomination.Still, this year’s race for the best-actress Oscar is so stacked with contenders that I’m ready to comb the academy bylaws for a workaround. 
1822	Are five slots really enough to honor a field this formidable? 
1823	Couldn’t we swipe a few more from the wan best-actor category, at least? 
1824	The truth is, even 10 slots would barely scratch the surface of what the best-actress race has to offer. 
1825	Many of the season’s most acclaimed films, like “Tár” and “Everything Everywhere All at Once,” have given career-best signature roles to their leading ladies, though only one woman can collect the Oscar. 
1826	Meanwhile, a vast array of up-and-comers, actresses playing against type and underdogs worth a second look will be vying simply to make the final five. 
1827	Here are the women contending in this season’s most exciting category.In the fictional world of “Tár,” the conniving conductor played by Cate Blanchett  has been showered with an absurd amount of awards. 
1828	By the end of this season, Blanchett herself may keep pace with her character.The two-time Oscar winner’s bravura performance — she learned German, orchestra conducting and piano for the role — has netted the most notable prizes so far: In addition to nominations from the Golden Globes, Critics Choice Awards, Independent Spirit Awards and Gotham Awards, Blanchett won the Volpi Cup for best actress at the Venice Film Festival and a pair of leading trophies from the New York Film Critics Circle and Los Angeles Film Critics Association. 
1829	The last time Blanchett triumphed with the critics groups on both coasts, she was well on her way to winning her second Oscar, for “Blue Jasmine.” 
1830	If she wins her third, the 53-year-old would be the youngest woman ever to reach that milestone. 
1831	(Meryl Streep, Frances McDormand and Ingrid Bergman are the only other actresses to have won three Oscars each for their performances, while Katharine Hepburn holds the record with four.) 
1832	But those laurels could also count against Blanchett in a race where her strongest competitor has never even been nominated and is angling for a historic win.Michelle Yeoh came close to snagging a supporting-actress nomination for “Crazy Rich Asians” (2018), but this time, she’s undeniable: The 60-year-old’s leading role in “Everything Everywhere All at Once ,” as an ordinary woman who becomes the multiverse’s last hope, should earn Yeoh her first Oscar nod.The role shows off everything Yeoh is capable of — including her athleticism, precise character work and sense of humor — and she has teared up in interviews while discussing how rarely a movie like that is offered to an Asian actress. 
1833	In a recent awards round table, Yeoh told the other actresses, “I honestly look at all of you with such envy because you get an opportunity to try all the different roles, but we only get that opportunity maybe once in a long, long time.” 
1834	Indeed, no Asian woman has ever won best actress, and after 94 ceremonies, the only winner of color in the category remains Halle Berry for “Monster’s Ball.” 
1835	Can Yeoh pull off a landmark victory? 
1836	It may help that she has a more sympathetic character arc: While Blanchett’s Lydia Tár compels and confounds in equal measure, Yeoh’s Evelyn Wang learns to drop her guard and let love in. 
1837	But the competition in this category is fierce, and Blanchett isn’t the only heavyweight she’ll be contending with.For playing a character based on Steven Spielberg’s mother in “The Fabelmans,” Michelle Williams  is likely to score her fifth Oscar nomination, which puts her behind Glenn Close and Amy Adams as the three living actresses who’ve been nominated the most times without having won. 
1838	That gives Williams a potent “she’s due” narrative that could siphon votes from both Blanchett and Yeoh; it helps, too, that she gives her all to the part, playing a vivacious woman whose spirit couldn’t be contained by her marriage.The “Till” star Danielle Deadwyler won the first lead-performance trophy of the season at last month’s Gotham Awards, and she’ll need that momentum to overcome striking snubs  from the Independent Spirits and Golden Globes. 
1839	Still, her emotionally precise performance as the mother of Emmett Till has Oscar-friendly heft, since voters often gravitate toward an actor playing a historical figure.It’s rarer that Oscar voters make room for an action heroine in the best-actress category: Though Sigourney Weaver earned a nomination for “Aliens,” Charlize Theron found no traction for “Mad Max: Fury Road.” 
1840	But there’s more to what Viola Davis does in “The Woman King ” than just wielding a spear. 
1841	Her fierce warrior is weary and her battle yells pack a cathartic punch. 
1842	If the movie can make it into the best-picture lineup, Davis should be swept in.Damien Chazelle’s debauched Hollywood dramedy “Babylon” has earned wildly mixed reviews, but the director helmed two Oscar-winning performances — Emma Stone in “La La Land” and J.K. Simmons in “Whiplash” — and that pedigree has pushed Margot Robbie  into contention for her role as a fledgling actress convinced of her own star quality. 
1843	Nominations for “I, Tonya” and “Bombshell” prove that voters like Robbie in ambitious-striver mode, though the movie is stuffed so full of characters that she can’t quite dominate the proceedings like some of her best-actress competition.Can two Oscar favorites overcome muted streaming launches in a year when theatrical contenders reign supreme? 
1844	“Good Luck to You, Leo Grande” hands Emma Thompson a sexually frank showcase role that had Oscar pundits buzzing at January’s Sundance Film Festival, but the film’s quiet June debut on Hulu drew fewer headlines. 
1845	And despite a best-picture win this year for “CODA,” Apple TV+ still struggles to get all those “Ted Lasso” and “Severance” viewers to watch exclusive movies like “Causeway,” though the film features a strong, back-to-basics lead performance from Jennifer Lawrence .
1846	At least “Blonde” managed a streaming debut that got people talking, though the punishing Netflix drama about Marilyn Monroe had some awfully loud detractors. 
1847	Can its star, Ana de Armas, rise above those pans ? 
1848	She managed a Golden Globe nomination, at least, and Oscar voters love to single out a rising ingénue, but the film will prove a tough sit in a year with plenty of better-received options.In the first hour of “Empire of Light,” Olivia Colman  plays a movie-theater worker who opens herself up to an appealing romance, but in the second, the character goes off her meds and the movie goes off the rails. 
1849	Even if those two halves don’t quite cohere, Colman definitely gets some big moments to play, and the actress has so quickly become an Oscar mainstay (over the last four years, she has been nominated three times and won once) that she should be considered a perennial option for the final five.Rooney Mara is spirited and sensitive in “Women Talking,”  but the studio’s decision to campaign her as a lead actress is tenuous: In this ensemble drama about conflicted Mennonite women, Mara has scarcely more screen time than Claire Foy or Jessie Buckley, who are being positioned as supporting-actress contenders. 
1850	Then again, Mara is no stranger to category high jinks: Six years ago, she was nominated as a supporting actress for “Carol,” even though she was clearly playing that film’s protagonist.If social media memes could be counted as accolades, Mia Goth  would surely give Blanchett’s haul a run for her money: The young actress’s work in “Pearl,” in which she plays a farm girl who’d kill for stardom, has Twitter awash in Goth GIFs. 
1851	Ti West’s technicolor horror drama isn’t the sort of thing that Oscar voters usually go for, but Goth is fearsomely committed, knocking out a tour de force, eight-minute monologue that’s topped only by a sustained closing shot of the actress smiling until she cries. 
1852	At the very least, it’d make for one memorable Oscar clip.I hope that as the membership of the academy grows ever more international, more powerhouse performances will be recognized in languages other than English. 
1853	In Park Chan-wook’s South Korean noir “Decision to Leave,” Tang Wei is a terrific femme fatale, while Léa Seydoux delivers her finest work as a single mother in the French drama “One Fine Morning.” 
1854	And Oscar voters who regret snubbing Vicky Krieps  for “Phantom Thread” could make it up to her by checking out the royal drama “Corsage,” in which she plays Empress Elisabeth of Austria with beguiling irreverence.Comedic actresses are too often undervalued by Oscar voters, but Aubrey Plaza spent 2022 proving she was capable of much more: Fans of her breakout performance in HBO’s “The White Lotus” should check out her dark, edgy work in the drama “Emily the Criminal,” which earned nominations from the Gothams and Indie Spirits. 
1855	And “Nope,” which topped our critic A.O. Scott’s list of the best films of the year, boasts a charismatic star turn by Keke Palmer  that recently earned a win from the New York Film Critics Circle, even if the group had to pretend she gave a supporting performance to get her out of the way of Blanchett’s leading win. 
1856	Normally, I’d discourage that kind of category fraud, but in this crowded year, I sympathize with the desire to bend some rules.
1857	In some of my earliest kitchen memories, I’m handed a pile of dough scraps to roll and cut into circles and stars. 
1858	I glue them onto shiny, sealed pies with a bit of slippery egg wash — a small but meaningful contribution to our holiday pies. 
1859	When I make pies now, I hand off the scraps to my nephews, who are honestly just as entertained by lumps of raw puff pastry as they are by tins of foam and sand slimes. 
1860	They use cookie cutters to stamp out some candy canes, or place abstract shapes on the exact part of the pie they plan to eat later.The casual, communal prep, and the ease of baking a single dish in the oven for dinner, is part of why my family is still so drawn to savory pies during the holidays, whether it’s a Swiss chard slab pie made with leaves and stems, a beet and beet green pie tucked in layers of phyllo, a coiled winter squash pie or a mash-topped, lentil-filled shepherd’s pie bubbling away at the edges. 
1861	(If you’re cooking with kids, you could encourage them to use a fork to make a pattern in the mashed potatoes before you bake it — a fun job!)Yotam Ottolenghi’s new butternut squash, leek and za’atar pie  is great for anyone looking to get ahead on their holiday cooking. 
1862	It tastes even better if you assemble it the day before and give the vegetables a day to rest in the fridge before baking. 
1863	To prep, roast butternut squash with maple syrup and cinnamon, then mix it with cream cheese and feta. 
1864	Sandwich that mix, along with sautéed leeks, scallions and garlic, between two giant rectangles of puff pastry.To make a meal out of that beauty, or any one of these pies, I’d make this insalata verde , which Samin Nosrat adapted from the New York restaurant Via Carota. 
1865	With a simple dressing made with shallots, sherry vinegar and mustards, and a mix of leaves — butter lettuce, romaine, endive, watercress and frisée — it really goes with everything. 
1866	Go to the recipe. 
1867	Go to the recipe. 
1868	Go to the recipe.If you’re looking to bake something sweet for a crowd for breakfast or an afternoon snack, Sohla El-Waylly’s giant almond croissant  is an enormous, efficient and truly stunning way to go. 
1869	Sohla adds a touch of rum to the frangipane, which you can make up to three days ahead and keep ready to go, before layering it with some sliced almonds onto two sheets of puff pastry, much like a slab pie. 
1870	For the full almond croissant effect, don’t be afraid to bake it until the pastry is properly dark brown and crunchy on the edges.Thanks for reading the Veggie.

1912	The course is a real beauty: It takes you from Bethesda Terrace, past the Reservoir and back down again.
1913	Sordid yet transcendent, bathed in neon haze and set to a relentless techno-beat, Hou Hsiao-hsien’s “Millennium Mambo”  — the tale of a teenage Taipei club girl — is not only the most pop movie the great Taiwanese filmmaker has ever made but, intermittently, among the most astonishingly beautiful. 
1914	The movie has a capital-L look, and the 4K restoration, opening at Metrograph in Manhattan on Dec. 23, does it justice.
1915	“Millennium Mambo” premiered at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival, where it was given a mixed reception and an award for sound design. 
1916	Hou’s first feature since his exquisite period piece “Flowers of Shanghai ,” the movie marked his entry into contemporary territory occupied by two of his younger admirers, the filmmakers Olivier Assayas and Wong Kar-wai.Hou’s frequent cinematographer, Mark Lee Ping-bin, had just shot Wong’s “In the Mood For Love,”  and he reprised its voluptuous imagery: Cigarettes are orange points of light in the blue-on-blue disco where Vicky (Shu Qi) spends her nights; the cramped, cruddy apartment she shares with her emotionally abusive boyfriend, a DJ wannabe (Tuan Chun-hao), is a perfumed miasma. 
1917	The pad’s lush mise-en-scène sets up a shock cut to a gyrating butt in the hostess bar where Vicky has taken a job and where she meets her sometime protector, a benign gangster with a Buddhist streak (Hou regular Jack Kao).
1918	Some took “Millennium Mambo” as Hou’s misguided attempt to connect with a younger generation, perhaps forgetting that he had begun his career as a commercial filmmaker and made more than a few “youth films” — notably the not dissimilar and initially underappreciated “Daughter of the Nile.”According to Maggie Cheung, Hou had originally wanted her to play Vicky, opposite Tony Leung, her co-star from “In the Mood for Love.” 
1919	Shu Qi is a less subtle actor than Cheung, but the movie is stronger for it. 
1920	Stunningly photogenic, remote and self-destructive, alternately passive and hysterical, Shu Qi’s character lives in a trance, reminiscent of the Warhol superstar Edie Sedgwick. 
1921	As the New York Times critic Elvis Mitchell wrote in his mildly favorable review, “the insistence of high-throb electronica calls out to Vicky, so that she pounds the thoughts out of her head.” 
1922	Vicky’s neurotic behavior makes “Millennium Mambo” almost a case history or, given her repetitive voice-over narration, a kind of ballad. 
1923	At the same time, like other Hou films, it is a temporal pretzel. 
1924	Vicky narrates her story, apparently set in the year 2000, from a point 10 years in the future. 
1925	Not infrequently we hear about events before we see them.Most mysterious are the brief sequences set in the sleepy, snowy Japanese island of Hokkaido — an alpine environment far different from steamy Taipei. 
1926	Are these unmotivated scenes a flash-forward to Vicky’s untroubled future? 
1927	A deliberately unconvincing happy ending à la Douglas Sirk? 
1928	A fantasy triggered by her chance encounter, while clubbing, with two Japanese brothers? 
1929	That the director is something of a Japanophile — and that, in a spasm of narrative ambiguity, Vicky finds herself in the snowbound town that hosts the Yubari International Fantastic Film Festival — could support any of these theories.Millennium MamboOpens Dec. 23 at Metrograph, Manhattan; metrograph.com .

1934	This year had a bit of everything for sports fans — and here are some of our favorite moments.ALCARAZ BEHIND THE BACK WHAT?!!?!?! pic.twitter.com/ylewLwrqxuIn the context of a match that lasted five sets, went on for 315 minutes and ended at 2:50 a.m. 
1935	Eastern time , 24 minutes later than any previous U.S. Open match, this point was ultimately meaningless. 
1936	Carlos Alcaraz didn’t win that game, or even the second-set tiebreaker that followed. 
1937	It was 11:25 p.m., but the night was young, and there would be so many more highlight-reel moments on the way to Alcaraz’s triumph in a quarterfinal against Jannik Sinner of Italy. 
1938	But this running-the-wrong-way, behind-the-back improvisation is the essence of Alcaraz, already the ultimate tennis jazz musician at 19, making it up as he goes along, the notes and the songs beautiful and breathtaking.
1939	— Matthew FuttermanJa Morant is already known for his gravity-defying dunk attempts  at this early stage of his career. 
1940	A key to becoming a truly successful daring dunker is combining athleticism with a limitless imagination. 
1941	Morant has left several victims in his wake, but this one sticks out. 
1942	It arrived during a first-round playoff series against Minnesota when Morant’s Memphis Grizzlies desperately needed a boost. 
1943	Morant, one of only a couple of elite players who possess the conviction to begin their ascent beyond the restricted area, triumphantly delivered.
1944	— Jonathan Abrams The point appeared to be lost. 
1945	In the opening round of the N.C.A.A. Division I women’s volleyball tournament, a South Dakota spike caromed off Houston’s Morgan Janda, who tried to receive it and bump it, and sailed past the court, headed toward the crowd. 
1946	But Kate Georgiades of Houston did not give up. 
1947	She barreled through a courtside table and made the play. 
1948	The rally continued, and ultimately Houston won the point, with Georgiades returning to the play and contributing. 
1949	The Cougars won the match, too, on their way to the third round.
1950	— Victor MatherYordan Alvarez of the Houston Astros hit a go-ahead home run in a World Series clincher, Bryce Harper launched a moonshot that put the Philadelphia Phillies in the World Series for the first time since 2009 and Cal Raleigh ended the Seattle Mariners’ 21-year playoff drought with a walk-off homer against Oakland .
1951	All were great moments, but they could not match the relentless anticipation and thrilling payoff of the Yankees’ Aaron Judge breaking Roger Maris’s American League single-season record with his 62nd homer of the year and Albert Pujols of the St. Louis Cardinals defying the odds with a resurgent second half to become the fourth member of Major League Baseball’s 700-homer club .
1952	— Benjamin HoffmanIt came down to the final trick for Eileen Gu in freestyle skiing’s big air competition at the Beijing Olympics. 
1953	A San Francisco teenager competing for China, her mother’s native country, Gu had one jump to win gold in her first event of the Games, amid all the adoration and all the questions  about her ambitions and choice to represent China.And she nailed it, landing a left double 1620 with a safety grab, a trick that involves four and a half revolutions in the air, and one she had never tried before in competition. 
1954	( Here’s the video.) 
1955	She won the gold medal  and went on to win another gold and a silver in other events — one of the most clutch performances at any Games.
1956	— John BranchI was sitting about a hundred yards from this play, in the end zone press box at the Buffalo Bills’ stadium, but even from my vantage point, it was obvious that this catch by the Minnesota Vikings’ Justin Jefferson made no sense. 
1957	I thought for sure that Bills cornerback Cam Lewis had pulled the ball down because he was using two arms and Jefferson was using one. 
1958	Then I thought the ball had hit the ground and the play was over. 
1959	Only then did I realize that Jefferson had cradled the ball before hitting the turf. 
1960	If he didn’t make that catch, the Vikings would have turned the ball over on downs and the Bills could have run out the clock. 
1961	Instead, after even more surprises , the Vikings went on to win in overtime. 
1962	Remarkable.
1963	— Ken BelsonThis year’s U.S. Open was a prime-time stage for Serena Williams , who used it to flash the kinds of moments that made her a fan favorite as she wound down her tennis career. 
1964	The crowds in Queens  responded to each hype-building scream, and some fans even broke traditional norms of etiquette at times because they wanted her to win so badly. 
1965	And they responded when she controlled the court, especially when she busted out one of her more difficult signature shots: a swinging forehand volley winner that requires precise timing and often throws off opponents.
1966	— Oskar GarciaFour long years after a potentially soul-crushing fifth-place finish at the 2018 Winter Games, Nathan Chen was a stunning example of resilience when he won the Olympic gold medal in men’s singles figure skating, finally. 
1967	In one of the best Olympic comeback stories ever, he dominated the competition  at the Beijing Games, performing with such confidence and flair that he made landing his five sky-scraping quadruple jumps look easy — and even fun. 
1968	It was a breathtaking performance by one of the best figure skaters in history.
1969	— Juliet MacurThe 2022 World Cup final has a strong claim to be the best ever, and for a number of good reasons.

1971	For the penalty shootout victory that delivered Argentina its third title  and finally ended Lionel Messi’s near two-decade search for the one title he craved. 
1972	But it will also be remembered for delivering one of the best goals of all time in a final: a sweeping team move from defense to attack, on the biggest stage possible, with Messi inevitably involved along the journey, a one-touch odyssey that ended when Ángel Di María slammed the ball home. 
1973	And, of course, in the game before, Messi had an incredible assist against Croatia, schooling Josko Gvardiol, a young man who is destined to develop into one of the best defenders of his generation.

2015	— Ken Belson
2016	Every so often, “Women Talking” lets its attention wander away from its main concern (which is, as you might have guessed, women talking) to observe the hands of girls as they draw pictures, play complicated clapping and string-figure games or braid one another’s hair into intricate plaits. 
2017	The grace and discipline of those activities, and the creativity they express, are woven into the film itself, which seems plain-spoken almost to the point of artlessness and turns out to be as layered and whorled as a hand-woven tapestry.The women are members of an agrarian religious community that has kept its distance from modernity. 
2018	An outsider’s pickup truck blasting the Monkees’ “Daydream Believer” is one of a handful of signs that this movie, directed by Sarah Polley from a novel by Miriam Toews,  takes place anywhere near the present. 
2019	Toews’s book was suggested by actual events that took place in the 1960s at a Mennonite colony in Bolivia, but the film version doesn’t specify a location or a time. 
2020	That vagueness reflects both the universality of the story’s themes and what the women know of the secular world, which is very little. 
2021	Though many of them can recite the Bible from memory, they haven’t been taught to read and write. 
2022	Their educations have been minimal, but their wisdom, acquired through farm and household labor, child-rearing, prayer and intuition, is vast. 
2023	Or at least sufficient to spur the emergence of a powerful and sophisticated collective political consciousness. 
2024	How they arrive at a clear understanding of their oppression and potential liberation is the film’s subject, a source of suspense, emotion and inspiration. 
2025	What the women are talking about is what some of the men in the colony have done to them. 
2026	Or maybe not quite that: They all know that a large number of their husbands, brothers, relatives and neighbors have been sneaking into the bedrooms of women and girls at night, equipped with a spray used to tranquilize livestock, and raping their unconscious victims. 
2027	A few flashbacks to the aftermaths of some of the attacks are sufficient to convey their horror. 
2028	Now that the colony’s elders have admitted the problem and the secular authorities have gotten involved, the question is how to respond. 
2029	While most of the men are away, bailing the accused perpetrators out of jail, a group of women meets in a hayloft to hash out a course of action. 
2030	The women of the community have already voted in a referendum offering three choices: do nothing — forgive, forget and hope for the best; stay and fight; or leave. 
2031	The first option having been soundly rejected, they settle in to debate the other two, arguing the relative merits of exit and voice. 
2032	Many of the participants favor exit, but “Women Talking,” as its title suggests, is mostly voice — a weave of voices in varying arrangements of harmony and dissonance. 
2033	The calmest and most measured, but also in some ways the most passionate and principled, belongs to Ona (Rooney Mara), who is pregnant. 
2034	Salome (Claire Foy) and Mariche (Jessie Buckley), two mothers of young children, provide antiphonal chords of anger. 
2035	Both are victims of male violence, but they often turn their rage on each other. 
2036	Two older women, Greta (Sheila McCarthy) and Agata (Judith Ivey), offer sympathy, perspective and occasional grandma jokes, though the necessary spark of mischief comes from the younger generation, boisterously represented by Liv McNeil, Michelle McLeod and Kate Hallett. 
2037	There’s also a man in the barn, whose job is to take the minutes of the meeting. 
2038	His name is August, and he’s played with appropriate sensitivity by Ben Whishaw. 
2039	In the book, he is also the narrator, but Polley has replaced him with a woman whom it might be a spoiler to name, leaving August as a reminder that while not all men are monsters to women, every man is implicated in the arrangements of power that enable the monstrosity. 
2040	But the movie isn’t about the men. 
2041	They are a blank that it’s easy enough to fill in, a set of facts implied in the words and silences of the women. 
2042	Away from their husbands, fathers, brothers and sons, the main characters experience a comfort that is clearly familiar, and a freedom that feels new. 
2043	Their personalities peek out from behind the scrim of their defined, taken-for-granted roles. 
2044	“Women Talking” compels you to think about their plight, but it also invites you to enjoy their company. 
2045	It seems contrary to Polley’s democratic method to single out performances for praise, but I found myself coming back to the wit that percolates underneath Foy’s ferocity, the deep sorrow behind McCarthy’s patience, Ivey’s beatitude, Hallett’s rambunctious high humor, Frances McDormand’s heartbreaking silence and August Winter’s unaffected dignity as a gender-nonconforming character named Melvin. 
2046	And also the poetry of Polley’s images (shot by Luc Montpellier), which show the beauty of life in the colony. 
2047	Following Toews — and the women themselves, whose faith informs their rebellion — Polley takes the religious life of the colony seriously, refusing to treat it as exotic or outlandish. 
2048	The point of leaving isn’t to reject belief, but to reestablish it on a firmer, more coherent moral basis, to imagine “a new colony” of trust and safety.That idea is by definition Utopian, and also consistent with the radical Christian tradition that the existing colony represents. 
2049	The root of Protestantism, after all, is protest — against arbitrary and unaccountable authority in the name of a higher truth. 
2050	“Women Talking” reawakens that idea and applies it, with precision and passion, to our own time and circumstances. 
2051	The women don’t want pity or revenge. 
2052	They want a better world. 
2053	Why not listen?

2058	On a hot summer day in 1961, a young TV writer and aspiring comedian named Dick Cavett attended the funeral of George S. Kaufman, the renowned wit and man of letters. 
2059	There he saw one of his heroes, Groucho Marx. 
2060	Cavett approached Marx, and managed to tell him that he was a big fan.Without missing a beat, Marx responded: “Well, if it gets any hotter, I could use a big fan.”“That was the beginning of our friendship,” Cavett said last month. 
2061	“I thought, well God, I’ve talked to him for actual minutes now. Nobody’s going to believe this. And suddenly he said: ‘Well, you seem like a nice young man. I’d like you to have lunch with me.’” 
2062	Now, 61 years later, their relationship is the subject of a new PBS documentary, “Groucho & Cavett,” which premieres on Tuesday as part of the “American Masters” series. 
2063	In a video interview from his home in Ridgefield, Conn., Cavett, 86, recalled with fondness his old friend, whose affection and mentorship changed the young Cavett’s life. 
2064	As a writer for “The Tonight Show,” Cavett went on to write for Marx when Marx joined a brief rotation of hosts after Jack Parr left the show, in 1962. 
2065	Starting in 1968, when Cavett got his own program on ABC, “The Dick Cavett Show,” Marx was a frequent guest. 
2066	“Groucho & Cavett,” directed by Robert S. Bader, captures the mutual affection between Marx, who was in the later stage of his career, and Cavett, a talk-show host on the rise during a tumultuous time in American history. 
2067	It also gives occasion to consider Cavett’s role in TV culture as an erudite, risk-taking and durable presence whose guests came on to engage in thoroughgoing, often contentious discussion with a dash of witty repartee.
2068	“There was nothing like it on television then, and there’s nothing like it on television now,” Bader said. 
2069	“It was actually an intelligent conversation with people you care about, where in other settings, you just see them trying to be clever for eight minutes.” 
2070	Bader’s first passion was Groucho — “I was an adolescent Marx Brothers fanatic,” he said. 
2071	As a child he would sit by the television and tape Marx’s Cavett appearances with a cassette recorder. 
2072	In college, Bader got the chance to meet Cavett, and he asked him a barrage of questions about Marx, which Cavett was happy to answer.By then, Bader was also a Cavett fan: “I realized he had got some pretty interesting people on,” he said. 
2073	“It wasn’t just Groucho.” 
2074	He went on to become friends with Cavett, producing a series of DVD compilations of the show and eventually making a documentary, “Ali & Cavett: Tale of the Tape,” about Cavett and his frequent guest Muhammad Ali. 
2075	But the one he really wanted to make was “Groucho & Cavett.” 
2076	You never knew what you might get when Marx walked onto Cavett’s stage — he was a guest seven times — but then that was true of “The Dick Cavett Show” in general. 
2077	Across four decades and in various iterations, the show was a future time capsule of the politics, letters, movies, art and music of its day. 
2078	Indeed, if you were a cultural figure and you didn’t visit Cavett’s show at the height of its influence in the 1960s and ’70s, it was almost as if you didn’t exist. 
2079	The show’s ascendancy coincided with the popularization of rock ’n’ roll subculture, and Cavett took all comers, making them accessible to a wide viewership, in part, by keeping a foot planted firmly in the intellectual traditions of his mentors. 
2080	Rock artists were among his most memorable guests, including Janis Joplin (who seemed to have a blast), Jimi Hendrix (exhausted, but engaged) and John Lennon and Yoko Ono (quite serious, as usual).
2081	“It’s funny because I never gave a damn about rock ’n’ roll until they started appearing on my show,” said Cavett, who just turned 86. 
2082	“I think Janis Joplin was partly responsible because she had such a good time and she told everybody about it. And then I began to get them one after the other.” 
2083	Marx remained friends with Cavett throughout the turbulent ’60s and gave him career advice. 
2084	As explained in the film, Marx saw an appealing contradiction in Cavett, the Yale-educated Nebraskan, the erudite hayseed. 
2085	Marx encouraged his young friend to pursue this idea through humor, and Cavett obliged. 
2086	When Cavett got his own show, he was quick to book his hero. 
2087	Marx would sing songs (“Lydia the Tattooed Lady”), tell stories and engage with the adoring audience. 
2088	But mostly he would riff with his young protégé, who always seemed as if he couldn’t believe he was sitting there with Groucho Marx.
2089	“I think I was in a state of exalting disbelief and joy that I had Groucho sitting there and being Groucho Marx,” Cavett said. 
2090	“I don’t remember being nervous, but I was just so damn grateful that I finally had him where I wanted him, so to speak. And that it was going well, and that it was wonderful.”Much of the time, Cavett was in stitches — Marx was, in that sense, one of the few guests who could render him speechless. 
2091	“Virtually everything he says, if he wants it to be and he usually does, can be funny,” Cavett said. 
2092	He rattled off some of his favorites. 
2093	Like: “I’m not a vegetarian, but I eat animals who are.” 
2094	Or: “Those are my principles, and if you don’t like them … well, I have others.” (This writer’s favorite, from “Animal Crackers”: “One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got in my pajamas, I’ll never know.”) Cavett wasn’t too shabby himself.
2095	“It was like you were listening to someone in the ’60s from the Algonquin Round Table,” said Ron Simon, the head of the curatorial department and senior curator at the Paley Center for Media, who has done several events with Cavett. 
2096	“He could always come up with the precise word. And certainly there is a little bit of Groucho in Dick Cavett and his humor. So Cavett was talking to one of his idols, and that made it special.”It’s easy to see what Marx admired in his young friend. 
2097	Cavett was soft-spoken but razor-sharp and unflappable, even when chaos was breaking out around him. 
2098	(Listen to his voice barely change when in 1971 he offers a pugnacious Norman Mailer  “two more chairs to contain your giant intellect.”) 
2099	For a time, he grew his sandy hair long. 
2100	He grew a beard. 
2101	Richard Nixon wanted to destroy him. 
2102	But his temperament didn’t change: He was insatiably curious and quick, whether he was talking to Truman Capote, Lillian Gish, Ronald Reagan, Sly Stone or Orson Welles. 
2103	Today, one can scarcely watch a documentary about a late-60s or ’70s subject without a vintage Cavett clip popping up — Zelig-like, he stamps his mark on the subject at hand.Cavett knows he had the goods back then. 
2104	“When I see myself on Decades, I’m often surprised at how good I am,” he said, referring to a network that carries reruns of his show. 
2105	“That’s a terrible thing to say in public, but I’m completely entertained by myself.” 
2106	Marx was entertained, too. 
2107	He saw in Cavett a kindred spirit, a fellow wit. 
2108	“Groucho was young in mind, although old in body at that point,” Bader said. 
2109	He was still widely beloved, known for the television show “You Bet Your Life,” which he hosted from 1947 to 1961. 
2110	The counterculture had embraced the anarchic spirit of movies like “The Cocoanuts” (1929), “Duck Soup” (1933) and “A Night at the Opera” (1935). 
2111	He was a sort of éminence grise in American comedy, still revered by younger comics like Cavett. 
2112	And Marx in turn never tired of the stage lights.
2113	“Dick gave Groucho this wide open forum, which he didn’t necessarily have when he went on other shows,” Bader said. 
2114	“He would just take over.” 
2115	Cavett tears up in the film as he recalls Marx’s death in 1977 at age 86. 
2116	“We had lost Captain Spaulding,” he says in the film, referring to the name of the character Marx played in the 1930 movie “Animal Crackers.” 
2117	For nine years, their friendship was a joyous on-air affair. 
2118	But he still has the memories and stories, which he loves to share. 
2119	Like the time a couple recognized the two men on a New York sidewalk and the man asked Marx to say something insulting about his wife.Marx paused, Cavett told me, then replied: “‘Well, with a wife like that, you should be able to think of your own insults.’“Let’s put it his way,” Cavett added. 
2120	“I’ve never enjoyed a guest more.”
2121	It has become wearyingly routine: Americans are embarking upon yet another holiday travel season in the midst of a viral onslaught .
2122	New, immune evasive versions of the Omicron variant are spreading, and Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths are once again rising , although the figures remain far below last winter’s peak. 
2123	But this year the coronavirus has company: Common seasonal viruses, which lay low for the last two winters, have come roaring back. 
2124	“And as it turns out, they have some makeup work to do,” said Peter Graven, who directs the office of advanced analytics at Oregon Health & Science University.In particular, influenza and R.S.V., or respiratory syncytial virus, hit early and hard this fall, causing major outbreaks that are now overlapping with a resurgent coronavirus. 
2125	This viral pileup — what some are calling a “tripledemic” — has already set off an exhausting season of sickness, triggering sky-high demand for pain and fever relievers and pushing children’s hospitals  to the brink. 
2126	But each of these three viruses is on a slightly different trajectory. 
2127	Although there is considerable geographic variation, in most parts of the country R.S.V. has probably already peaked, while flu is now surging, experts said. 
2128	And Covid is still ramping up, with cases likely to continue rising.That means that more difficult, fever-filled weeks still lie ahead. 
2129	“A lot of sniffly kids,” said Andrew Lover, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the UMass Amherst School of Public Health and Health Sciences. 
2130	“There’ll be a lot of respiratory illness floating around from all these different sources.” 
2131	It is not too late to get a Covid booster or a flu shot, which appears to be well-matched to the influenza strains circulating this year, scientists said. 
2132	And experts repeated their now-common exhortations to take basic precautions, such as wearing masks in crowded indoor spaces, using rapid Covid tests before visiting vulnerable people and staying home when feeling unwell.
2133	“I know people are kind of tired of hearing some of that stuff,” Dr. Graven said. 
2134	“We’re not saying people need to change your life forever. Right now, for the next some number of weeks, we’re in not a great spot.” 
2135	Scientists are hopeful that next winter will be better, noting that this brutal season is an unfortunate, and not entirely unexpected, byproduct of several years of pandemic precautions, such as masking and social distancing. 
2136	These measures shielded many people from routine winter infections and may have spared overburdened health care systems from even bigger surges. 
2137	But many children and adults also missed out on the opportunity to build or bolster their immune defenses against flu and R.S.V., leaving the viruses with an unusually vulnerable population this fall.
2138	“There was a bit of a buildup of susceptibility at the population level,” said Virginia Pitzer, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health. 
2139	“It’s a worse than normal winter, but one that hopefully will not be repeated next year.”The first virus to surge this fall was R.S.V., which usually causes mild illness but can be severe, or even fatal, in older adults and young children. 
2140	By the time children in the United States are two years old, almost all have been exposed to the virus .
2141	The virus typically peaks in December or January. 
2142	But this year, cases of R.S.V. began rising steeply in September, and by mid-November, pediatric hospitalization rates  had hit the highest level since tracking began in 2018. 
2143	Hospitalization rates for older adults have surged, too.Flu took off in October, about six weeks ahead of schedule, and has already caused at least 150,000 hospitalizations  and 9,300 deaths, according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
2144	The cumulative hospitalization rate is higher for this time of year than it has been in more than a decade.
2145	“We had a huge pool of people, compared to what we normally do, who could be infected by R.S.V. and could be infected by flu because we’ve basically missed two seasons of it,” said Jeffrey Shaman, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Columbia University. 
2146	As a result, he said, the viruses were “able to go to work early and infect a lot of people. And that’s why we’re seeing these very large, marked outbreaks early on.”There have also been reports that cases of invasive infections of group A Streptococcus bacteria, or strep A, may be on the rise in the United States and Europe . 
2147	Although these cases remain rare, they may be related to the recent surges in flu and R.S.V., which can leave people more vulnerable to invasive strep, officials have said.However, some encouraging signs have recently emerged, especially regarding R.S.V. Nationally, hospitalization rates and R.S.V. detections  have fallen since mid-November, according to C.D.C. data.
2148	“I think it’s likely that the R.S.V. season has peaked in most parts of the country,” Dr. Pitzer said. 
2149	“I think that there is a light at the end of the tunnel.” 
2150	The trajectory of the flu surge is more difficult to discern, scientists said. 
2151	Levels of the virus are still very high, and some locations may be seeing their flu peaks now. 
2152	“It still looks really serious most everywhere,” Dr. Lover said.But there are hints that conditions may be beginning to improve in some areas of the country, including in parts of the South and the Mid-Atlantic States. 
2153	According to the C.D.C.’s latest influenza report , during the week that ended on Dec. 10, the percentage of laboratory samples testing positive for flu held steady, nationally, and the number of hospital admissions declined, compared with that of the previous week. 
2154	Several experts expressed hope that this year’s early-starting flu season might also end early, with cases plummeting quickly as the virus finds fewer people to infect. 
2155	“It burns through all the people who are susceptible to disease or to infection and doesn’t have as much fuel during the traditional season,” said Justin Lessler, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
2156	Earlier this year, for instance, Australia saw a severe, early flu season, with cases rising precipitously and then “crashing down pretty quickly,” Dr. Shaman noted.Alternatively, flu cases could plateau for a while. 
2157	In a number of California communities, the amount of influenza present in the wastewater has stopped rising but remains high, said Alexandria Boehm, an environmental engineer at Stanford University and a lead investigator for WastewaterSCAN , a national sewage surveillance initiative. 
2158	“That suggests that there are still quite a few infections,” she said. 
2159	Even if the current outbreak abates, another flu bump could occur later in the season, scientists said.
2160	“The optimistic view is that we had an early, severe season, and that hopefully what will happen over the next couple of weeks is that all of the numbers will start going down,” said Dr. Helen Chu, an infectious-disease physician and epidemiologist at the University of Washington. 
2161	“But the pessimistic view is that this is just the beginning, and then we’ll see a couple of later waves.” 
2162	Covid-19, on the other hand, appears to be on the upswing. 
2163	At many of WastewaterSCAN’s sites, coronavirus levels began increasing in early November and surged around Thanksgiving, Dr. Boehm said. 
2164	Levels are still trending upward at most sites, she said; at some, they are even approaching last winter’s peaks. 
2165	Officially recorded Covid cases, which remain a significant underestimate, have increased 24 percent over the past two weeks, while hospitalizations are up nine percent. 
2166	There are more than 400 Covid-related deaths a day, on average, a 41 percent jump from two weeks ago.Those figures are likely to rise further in the coming weeks, experts predicted, fueled by a combination of holiday travel, indoor gatherings, waning immunity and the spread of BQ.1 and BQ.1.1, two new, highly immune-evasive versions of Omicron. 
2167	(So far, these subvariants do not appear to be causing more severe disease than earlier forms of Omicron did, scientists said.) 
2168	The precise timing and size of a new Covid wave is difficult to predict, with experts forecasting that cases might peak nationally anytime between the end of December and early February. 
2169	Most predicted that high levels of pre-existing immunity — from vaccination, infection or both — would likely keep the overall toll lower than during previous winter surges. 
2170	“We’re going to get a noticeable and meaningful peak in hospitalizations and deaths but nothing that looks like what we saw the past two winters,” Dr. Lessler said. 
2171	The emergence of new variants remains a wild card. 
2172	The explosion of cases in China could theoretically increase that risk; the more the virus spreads, the more opportunities it has to mutate and evolve. 
2173	But new variants can emerge anywhere, and given how widespread the virus already is around the world, China’s current outbreak may not have “an appreciable impact on the rate at which new variants are emerging,” Dr. Lessler said.It remains too early to say whether flu and R.S.V. will return to their typical rhythms next year. 
2174	But not every winter will be this bad, scientists predicted. 
2175	“We are sort of making up for the immunity gap that existed during these last two years,” Dr. Chu said. 
2176	“Things will probably get better.” (An R.S.V. vaccine might be available by next winter, too, she noted.)Still, even before the pandemic, the flu burden varied widely from year to year — a bad season can cause more than 50,000 deaths and overwhelm hospitals  — and Covid is likely to remain part of the winter mix.
2177	“That’s going to run up the numbers every year, in terms of how many people have severe respiratory disease,” Dr. Lessler said. 
2178	“I wouldn’t be surprised if just the overall burden from severe respiratory disease is going to be higher in the coming decade than it was in the decade leading up to 2020.”
2179	Stocks fell sharply on Thursday as fresh economic data revived worries about the Federal Reserve’s attempts to battle inflation. 
2180	The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits increased less than expected last week, Labor Department data showed on Thursday, suggesting that the job market remained tight. 
2181	At the same time, an update on gross domestic product indicated that the economy rebounded faster than previously estimated in the third quarter. 
2182	Combined, the economic reports suggested to investors that the Federal Reserve might need to continue to push interest rates higher and hold them there longer in an attempt to slow the economy. 
2183	By afternoon trading, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average were down by more than 2 percent, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index was down by roughly 3.5 percent.S&P 500-%Dow-%Nasdaq-%As of Data delayed at least 15 minutesSource: FactSetStock trading has been volatile throughout the week as investors grapple with the Fed’s resolve to remain aggressive in its fight against inflation. 
2184	Fed officials indicated last week that interest rates would rise more drastically  than many had expected as policymakers try to wrangle stubborn price increases. 
2185	“We have more work to do,” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said last week. 
2186	The latest update on gross domestic product showed that the U.S. economy grew at an unexpectedly strong 3.2 percent annual pace from July through September. 
2187	The growth during the quarter followed a contraction during the first half of the year. 
2188	Investors will get another update on consumer spending and inflation Friday, when the government releases the personal consumption expenditure price index for November. 
2189	The report is monitored by the Fed as a barometer of inflation. 
2190	Despite Thursday’s strong numbers, a recent string of economic data has been mixed, and experts expect the coming expenditure report to show that inflation continued to cool in November.
2191	Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced former cryptocurrency executive, was granted release from custody on Thursday by a federal magistrate judge who imposed highly restrictive bail conditions including a $250 million bond and a requirement that he remain in home detention with his parents in California. 
2192	The appearance in Federal District Court in Manhattan came just hours after Mr. Bankman-Fried, 30, arrived in the United States following his extradition from the Bahamas, where he was arrested at a luxury apartment complex on Dec. 12 and held in a local jail. 
2193	Under the bail arrangement, Mr. Bankman-Fried will live with his parents in Palo Alto, Calif., under strict electronic monitoring, including a bracelet that will be placed on him before he leaves the courthouse. 
2194	The $250 million personal recognizance bond — a written promise to appear in court as needed — will be secured by his parents’ interest in their home, the judge said. 
2195	He was also required to surrender his passport and to receive mental health and substance abuse treatment. 
2196	Any expenses above $1,000 would require prior approval by the government. 
2197	The judge, Gabriel W. Gorenstein, warned Mr. Bankman-Fried that if he failed to appear in court or violated any of the other conditions, a warrant would be issued for his arrest and he and his parents would be responsible for paying the hefty bond. 
2198	Asked whether he understood, Mr. Bankman-Fried responded, “Yes, I do,” the only words he uttered in the hearing, which lasted less than an hour. 
2199	Discussions about a bail deal had begun even before Mr. Bankman-Fried was extradited. 
2200	In court on Thursday, the deal was formally proposed by the U.S. prosecutors in the Southern District of New York who brought the charges against Mr. Bankman-Fried. 
2201	Mr. Bankman-Fried was escorted into court wearing a dark suit and was seated between his two lawyers, Mark Cohen and Christian Everdell.Mr. 
2202	Cohen argued that Mr. Bankman-Fried was not a flight risk. 
2203	“My client voluntarily consented to come to face these charges here in New York,” he told the judge. 
2204	“He wants to address them.”Nicolas Roos, an assistant U.S. attorney, said Mr. Bankman-Fried had committed crimes of “epic proportions” and that the case against him involved multiple cooperating witnesses, as well as encrypted text messages and tens of thousands of pages of financial records. 
2205	But he noted that Mr. Bankman-Fried had “family and communities ties” and that his wealth had “diminished significantly.”“It would be very difficult for this defendant to hide without being recognized,” Judge Gorenstein said. 
2206	“So I believe that the risk of flight is appropriately mitigated.” 
2207	Mr. Bankman-Fried has been charged with two counts of wire fraud and six counts of conspiracy related to securities and commodities fraud, money laundering and violating the campaign finance laws.Ephrat Livni and Liset Cruz  contributed reporting.
2208	For years, live sports has been the last stitch holding the cable television bundle together even as more major games moved to streaming services. 
2209	Apple snatched up Major League Baseball games. 
2210	Amazon scored Thursday Night Football. 
2211	But the National Football League’s Sunday games, a centerpiece of American sports, have remained defiantly tied to traditional TV. 
2212	Until today. 
2213	On Thursday, YouTube and the National Football League announced that they had reached a deal for the N.F.L.’s Sunday Ticket package of games, as the tech giants Apple, Amazon and Alphabet, which owns YouTube, use their deep pockets and huge platforms to transform the business of live sports rights.
2214	“I think it’s a seismic deal,” said John Kosner, a former ESPN digital executive and the chief executive of the media consultancy Kosner Media. 
2215	“With this deal, the three major sleeping giants have all woken up.” 
2216	The deal will allow YouTube viewers to stream nearly all of the N.F.L. games on Sunday next season, except those that air on traditional television in their local markets. 
2217	Games will continue to be available on other networks throughout the week, including Monday night games on ESPN and ABC and Thursday evening games on Amazon’s Prime Video service. 
2218	The games will be available as an add-on for an additional fee to YouTube TV, the company’s $64.99 streaming package, or available for purchase separately through its YouTube Primetime Channels, another product. 
2219	The new Sunday Ticket deal could be worth as much as $2.5 billion annually, including payments from YouTube and separate agreements to license the package to businesses including bars and restaurants, according to people familiar with the negotiations. 
2220	That’s about $1 billion a year more than DirecTV, the previous rights holder. 
2221	The deal includes payments based on the number of YouTube subscribers that Google is able to add, as well as other performance benchmarks, the people said. 
2222	YouTube struck a seven-year agreement for Sunday Ticket, one of the people said, a long-term deal to give Google time to build its subscriber base. 
2223	DirecTV also agreed to long-term, multiyear deals. 
2224	“For a number of years we have been focused on increased digital distribution of our games and this partnership is yet another example of us looking towards the future and building the next generation of N.F.L. fans,” Roger Goodell, the N.F.L. commissioner, said in a statement.Still, a major chunk of N.F.L. games will be exclusive to traditional television for the next decade . 
2225	Last year, the league struck decade-long deals with major U.S. TV networks, including Fox, ESPN, CBS and NBC. 
2226	In recent years, the league has tried to generate extra income by selling streaming rights separately. 
2227	RedZone, a popular feature that allows fans to monitor Sunday games when teams get within scoring range, will no longer be available on DirecTV, but the N.F.L. will continue producing its own version of the broadcast, according to two people familiar with the matter not authorized to speak publicly. 
2228	That feature will be available to users through cable providers, such as Comcast, or through their Sunday Ticket subscription on YouTube. 
2229	In recent months, the league explored selling a stake in the N.F.L. network, its media arm, as part of the Sunday Ticket package. 
2230	Those talks did not result in a deal, and the N.F.L. will continue those talks, according to the two people familiar with the matter.The Sunday Ticket package could prove to be a boon to YouTube, which has been keen to expand its subscriptions as its main business — advertising — has stalled. 
2231	Football games could draw more sports fans to YouTube TV, which is already the most popular internet-based pay TV service. 
2232	The company said in July that it had five million subscribers , surpassing Hulu + Live TV. 
2233	YouTube gets the bulk of its revenue from advertising on videos uploaded by users. 
2234	Stubborn inflation and a slowing economy have prompted advertisers to pull back spending, causing YouTube’s ad sales to contract by almost 2 percent in the past quarter, Google’s parent company, Alphabet, reported in October.The disappointing results have given more urgency to a yearslong plan for YouTube to expand in other ways. 
2235	The company said in November that it had 80 million paying subscribers  for its music and ad-free premium services, up from 50 million a year earlier. 
2236	Earlier this year, YouTube said that YouTube TV had more than five million paid and trial users. 
2237	“YouTube has long been a home for football fans, whether they’re streaming live games, keeping up with their home team, or watching the best plays in highlights,” Susan Wojcicki, the chief executive of YouTube, said in a statement.The deal culminates years of industry speculation over who would land the coveted package of games that began in 2019 when John Stankey, then the chief operating officer of DirecTV’s former owner, AT&T, said the company was rethinking  its deal for Sunday Ticket.It became clearer that the package would go to a tech company in July, when Mr. Goodell, the N.F.L. commissioner, said  in an interview that a streaming service would be “best for consumers.” 
2238	Apple, Amazon and YouTube emerged as the likeliest candidates, and all three companies vied for the rights. 
2239	Recently, Apple — which was long considered the front-runner — decided to drop its pursuit. 
2240	As the negotiations stretched on, Apple became skeptical that the Sunday Ticket package was worth what the N.F.L. was seeking and ended serious conversations about a potential deal, a person with knowledge of the deal said.Apple instead homed its focus on completing a deal to sponsor the halftime show  for the 2023 Super Bowl, which it believes will raise the profile of its Apple Music service. 
2241	YouTube, on the other hand, resumed the negotiations after Thanksgiving, and the companies hammered out a deal within weeks.Tripp Mickle  contributed reporting.
2242	Oscar White Muscarella, an archaeologist who argued vociferously that antiquities collectors and museums — including his longtime employer, the Metropolitan Museum of Art — were fueling a market in forgeries and encouraging the plundering of archaeological sites, died on Nov. 27 at his home in Philadelphia. 
2243	He was 91. 
2244	His son, Lawrence, said the cause was complications of lymphoma, vascular disease and Covid. 
2245	Dr. Muscarella spent decades in the department of ancient Near Eastern art at the Met, participating in excavations in Iran and Turkey and writing dozens of scholarly papers and catalogs, as well as several books. 
2246	But his tenure at the Met, which had begun in 1964, turned contentious in the early 1970s when he sounded alarms about the museum’s acquisitions practices, especially its purchase of pieces of unclear origin.  
2247	He made headlines in 1978 with a paper that identified 247 objects or groups of objects in various museums as forged or of suspicious provenance.The study provoked strong reactions, including from Sherman Lee, director of the Cleveland Museum of Art, who told The New York Times, “We believe what it says on our labels.”“He is saying that everything is guilty until proven innocent,” Dr. Lee added. 
2248	“What he is really after is that there should be no traffic in antiquities.” 
2249	Dr. Muscarella didn’t dispute that.
2250	“I am against all buying of ancient art from dealers,” he told The Times. 
2251	“If the objects are genuine, we’re buying plundered art; if they are false, we’re buying forgeries. And the public is paying for these forgeries or for these bribes to looters and public officials.” 
2252	Dr. Muscarella saw dealers, forgers, plunderers, private collectors and museums as linked in a self-perpetuating and damaging system. 
2253	High prices paid by museums and collectors encouraged forgery and the looting of archaeological sites. 
2254	Acceptance of dubious provenance made for inaccurate art history and fueled a black-market system. 
2255	Museums and collectors (who were often the same rich people who financed museums) had a disincentive to expose forgeries because, among other things, it would make them look foolish for paying big money for fakes.
2256	“If collecting stopped,” Dr. Muscarella wrote in his book “The Lie Became Great: The Forgery of Ancient Near Eastern Cultures,” published in 2000, “plunder would stop — certainly it would be mitigated — and forgery manufacturing would decrease. But these arguments are derided as naïve by the self-serving and partisan collecting culture, which is essentially a component of the forgery culture.”Dr. 
2257	Muscarella excoriated magazines and newspapers — The Times included — that glorified wealthy collectors in lavishly illustrated feature articles. 
2258	As for the collectors themselves?
2259	“Lust to appropriate ‘antiquities’ is lust for power to annihilate the immortality of a culture,” he wrote in “The Lie Became Great.” “Collecting ancient artifacts — antiquities — is inherently immoral and unethical. Collecting antiquities is to archaeology as rape is to love.”Dr. 
2260	Muscarella’s strong stands and strong language earned him plenty of enemies, including Thomas Hoving , director of the Met from 1967 to 1977. 
2261	Dr. Muscarella spent much of the 1970s fending off Mr. Hoving’s attempts to fire him, bringing several court actions and ultimately winning a ruling from a fact-finder in 1977 that ended the legal proceedings. 
2262	In 1978 he was made a senior research fellow, and he held that post until retiring in 2009. 
2263	For all his detractors, Dr. Muscarella also had many admirers. 
2264	Elizabeth Simpson, professor emerita at the Bard Graduate Center in New York, edited a 2018 volume of essays by dozens of them, “The Adventure of the Illustrious Scholar: Papers Presented to Oscar White Muscarella,” and upon his death sent her own version of his obituary to colleagues.
2265	“He could be blunt and belligerent, offending those with whom he did not agree,” she wrote. 
2266	“But he was respected even by people who did not like him, who sought him out for his opinions, with his encyclopedic knowledge of ancient art and culture and his honesty and utter lack of pretension.” 
2267	Oscar White was born on March 26, 1931, in Manhattan to Oscar V. White, an elevator operator, and Anna Falcon. 
2268	According to an extensive biography by Professor Simpson in the “Illustrious Scholar” book, his parents were not married, and his mother soon left, abandoning young Oscar and his brother Bobby for a relationship with Salvatore Muscarella. 
2269	Her sons spent time in an orphanage and foster care, until, in 1937, “Anna found the boys and ‘kidnapped’ them,” Professor Simpson wrote, taking them to live with her and Mr. Muscarella in Manhattan. 
2270	The couple married in 1939, and Mr. Muscarella adopted the boys. 
2271	Oscar graduated from Stuyvesant High School, where he was in the archaeology club, in 1948. 
2272	In 1953, while studying at City College, he spent a summer on an archaeological dig at a Pueblo Indian site in Colorado, his first. 
2273	He graduated from City College with a history degree in 1955, then earned a Ph.D. in classical archaeology in 1965 from the University of Pennsylvania. 
2274	By then he had already joined the Met’s department of ancient Near Eastern art. 
2275	His first clash with Met management came in 1970, when he wrote a letter to Douglas Dillon, the museum’s incoming president, complaining of low wages, lack of advancement opportunities for women curators, and Mr. Hoving’s leadership style.
2276	“Dillon was not pleased,” Professor Simpson wrote in the book, “and he showed the letter to Hoving, who was not pleased either.” 
2277	The first attempt to fire Dr. Muscarella came the next year. 
2278	The year after that he retained a lawyer, and the long legal tussle was joined.One sore point involved a 2,500-year-old vase known as the Euphronios krater that the Met had acquired through a go-between named Robert Hecht , who had a spotty reputation and who said he was representing an Armenian collector. 
2279	Dr. Muscarella was among those calling out the Met for buying a piece of dubious provenance.
2280	“One must know where the vase came from,” he told The Times in 1973. 
2281	“There may be other objects with it, if it came from a tomb. Without the place of discovery, it is impossible to reconstruct its historical context.” 
2282	And then there was the price — about $1 million, a whopping figure for the time.
2283	“When thieves hear of these exorbitant prices, they naturally plunder tombs to get more loot,” he said in the same interview. 
2284	“Can we blame them any more than the people who pay them or the people who buy their finds?”Italian officials argued for years that the vase had been stolen by tomb robbers from a grave near Rome. 
2285	In 2008, amid much fanfare, the Met returned it to Italy . 
2286	While at the University of Pennsylvania in 1957, Dr. Muscarella married Grace Freed, a fellow graduate student. 
2287	She survives him, as do his son; a daughter, Daphne Dennis; a brother, Ronald; a sister, Arline Croce; and a granddaughter. 
2288	Today the art and collecting worlds are more conscious of the problems with trafficking in objects of unclear origin.
2289	“Because this practice is now widely censured by the archaeological community, it may be hard to remember how widespread the collection of stolen antiquities, even forgeries, was in the recent past,” Lynn Roller of the art history department at the University of California, Davis, wrote in reviewing Dr. Muscarella’s book “Archaeology, Artifacts and Antiquities of the Ancient Near East” in the Journal of the American Oriental Society in 2017. 
2290	“Muscarella’s stance as a voice of conscience for archaeological scholarship and ethical collecting may be his strongest contribution to the profession.”
2291	It cracked. 
2292	It creaked. 
2293	It leaked.Ever since the famed Spanish architect Rafael Guastavino  designed the enormous dome in the early 20th century at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, in the Manhattan neighborhood of Morningside Heights, it has been a source of wonder. 
2294	It has also been a cause for worry and woe, requiring seemingly endless repairs. 
2295	But now, after a painstaking three-year, $17 million rehabilitation — and just in time for Christmas festivities — the dome’s 113-year-old aches and pains have been tended to. 
2296	Its striking terra-cotta tile has been repaired, and a new copper exterior has been added. 
2297	“The new roofing could easily last 50 to a hundred years and there’s no reason it couldn’t last for centuries with good maintenance,” said Kevin Seymour, associate principal of Ennead, the architecture firm that was in charge of the work at the cathedral, the seat of the Episcopal diocese of New York.Originally constructed in 1909, the dome was one of the first things built at the famously unfinished cathedral, which still lacks a south transept (an arm extending southward to complete the church’s cross-shaped plan), not to mention the remainder of the two towers on the west facade, facing Amsterdam Avenue at 112th Street. 
2298	The cathedral, a concoction of Byzantine, Romanesque and Gothic styles that is the length of two football fields, making it the largest in the world, is nonetheless an official city landmark  as well as a beloved New York institution and popular tourist destination. 
2299	The dome was never meant to be permanent; rather, it was a temporary topping over the crossing’s four gigantic granite arches until a spire could be erected, at which point it was to be removed. 
2300	Nonetheless, the best dome maker of the day was called in for the job: the firm of the architect Rafael Guastavino Sr. and his son, Rafael Guastavino Jr., renowned for beautiful, lightweight, durable, self-supporting vaults and arches made from thin interlocking tiles and fast-drying mortar that didn’t require external supports. 
2301	The Guastavino Fireproof Construction Company built the dome by overlapping layers of terra-cotta tiles — more layers near the base and fewer toward the (thinner) center of the dome — and binding the base with a steel tension ring. 
2302	The firm completed the job in 15 weeks, including vaults below the crossing floor. 
2303	Because the dome was only provisional, however, it was never given a proper outer covering; instead, asphalt was slathered on top. 
2304	“They were always thinking that in 10 years’ time they would be building something else,” Mr. Seymour said.The interior of the dome was similarly unadorned — what one sees, looking up from inside the church, is simply the ruddy-hued, ridged underside of the tile, a workmanlike surface unlike the smooth, cream-colored finish of tiles with decorative glazing, the kind familiar from famous Guastavino marvels around New York, like the Registry Room at Ellis Island , the Oyster Bar in Grand Central Terminal and a vaulted space under the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge. 
2305	Still, the dome was nearly 135 feet wide, making it larger than any Guastavino’s firm had attempted before, and even today the largest of its domes. 
2306	It rises to 165 feet above the crossing floor — if the Statue of Liberty was spirited uptown from New York Harbor she would fit inside. 
2307	But the project perhaps stretched even the considerable powers of the Guastavinos. 
2308	By 1916, the dome was flattening and required reinforcing with steel tension rods encased in concrete. 
2309	A decade later, netting was hung below the underside of the dome to catch bits of mortar that might come loose. 
2310	Then came tinkering with the pendentives, the triangular sections over the crossing arches that support the dome. 
2311	They call themselves “Guastafarians” — fans of the engineering mastery of Rafael Guastavino, the Spanish architect who came to New York in 1881 with a special system for creating dramatic vaulted ceilings with terra-cotta tiles. 
2312	Working with his son, Rafael Guastavino Jr., he turned New York City spaces into instant landmarks. 
2313	Here are a few. 
2314	One example is the Manhattan Municipal Building, 1 Centre Street, shown in 2019.

2320	Guastavino vaults in the Registry Room on Ellis Island, shown in 2019.Keeping an anxious eye on it all, James Marston Fitch, the architect and preservationist who taught at nearby Columbia University, wrote in Architectural Forum in 1954 that the dome “shows signs of failure.” 
2321	He warned, “even with radical and expensive surgery it cannot last much longer.” 
2322	The main problem was that the dome expanded when the sun beat down on it, warming up the materials, and contracted when they cooled at night. 
2323	Seasonal weather changes compounded the problem. 
2324	All the movement caused cracking. 
2325	The cracks let rainwater seep in. 
2326	And water crept around inside walls, causing all sorts of damage. 
2327	Insulation added in the 1970s moderated temperature swings, helping for a while. 
2328	But a waterproofing membrane installed in the 1990s eventually tore, allowing water to soak the insulation. 
2329	Ultimately the dome was taking in more water than it was repelling. 
2330	Ad hoc repairs would never be enough. 
2331	“We realized we had to get down to the base and start again,” said James Patterson, the cathedral’s director of facilities and capital projects.Ennead, working with the structural engineering firm Silman , mapped out a plan. 
2332	The soggy old materials were stripped away and the tile was left to dry out under loose tarps that flapped in the wind, leading to fears that they might fly off and land in Central Park.Nicholson & Galloway, an exterior restoration contractor experienced with historical domes, repaired cracks in tiles, patched concrete, then layered on new protective materials : a hand-troweled vapor barrier, spray foam insulation, stainless-steel framing, plywood sheathing. 
2333	Topping it all is a new outer enclosure designed by Ennead and composed of slender, curved pie-shaped roof pans made of sheet copper — a material chosen to match other sections of the cathedral’s roof. 
2334	Flexible seams in the new enclosure can accommodate any dome movement.As soon as the exterior work was done, the underside of the tile was ministered to, coinciding with a cleanup in the cathedral after a 2019 fire that had left soot everywhere .
2335	Standing on towering scaffolding erected in the crossing, a team from Building Conservation Associates , led by senior conservator Laura Buchner, gently tapped on the thousands of tiles on the bottommost layer of the dome with special plastic mallets to determine which might be loose; these were remortared. 
2336	Cracked and water-damaged tiles were replaced with new ones custom-made at Sandkuhl Clay Works in Spencerville, Ohio. 
2337	Buchner was in awe of the old tilework as she examined it up close, noting how the color of the tiles selected for the center of the dome are lighter in color than the rest.
2338	“I find it to be beautiful, all those concentric circles,” she said. 
2339	“The dome may not have been intended to be permanent, but what it contributes to the overall design is very special.” 
2340	Silman attached electronic monitors to its underside to keep tabs on its temperature and any possible movement. 
2341	A new net — terra-cotta-colored so it blended in — was hung. 
2342	The roofing portion of the project, $16 million, was paid for with revenue from the sale of property to the north of the cathedral for an apartment complex, Patterson said. 
2343	Its new copper has already started to darken as it acquires a patina; it is expected to eventually turn verdigris, like the statue of angel Gabriel that has stood on the apse roof since the earliest parts of the church were built. 
2344	But even after all the care lavished on the dome, it is still considered only temporary, Mr. Patterson said. 
2345	The plan remains to one day build a spire. 
2346	But that won’t happen anytime soon, he added. 
2347	“We’re talking hundreds of years from now,” he said.
2348	The doctor eased his boat, the Sure Shot, out of its slip on Long Island late that October morning, guided it past Fire Island and into the Atlantic Ocean, toward where the big tuna were biting and away from a world of mounting troubles. 
2349	No lawyers, no federal agents, no courtrooms. 
2350	Dr. Marvin Moy, a Manhattan physician, was a regular fixture at the Center Yacht Club in the hamlet of Moriches. 
2351	Some club members arriving from the city were viewed as outsiders, but Dr. Moy moved with ease in this world, a fisherman’s fisherman who happened to have a busy day job. 
2352	Then, in January, Dr. Moy was indicted in federal court in Manhattan, charged with insurance fraud through his medical practice. 
2353	The government accused Dr. Moy and others of running a scam that involved bribing emergency responders and hospital employees to direct car crash victims to his pain management offices. 
2354	A conviction could have led to years in prison. 
2355	And he was in the midst of a long and bitter divorce from his wife of 14 almost entirely rocky years. 
2356	In court filings, he described disputes over custody of their daughter, age 12, and over finances. 
2357	The divorce case had dragged on for five years so far, and Dr. Moy had cycled through several lawyers, still owing one firm more than $69,000, according to a lawsuit against him. 
2358	But on Oct. 12, a calm and clear Wednesday, Dr. Moy was planning to leave all that behind. 
2359	He was bound for a popular area in the ocean called the Hudson Canyon, a journey of some six hours. 
2360	He had brought along a new acquaintance, Max Wong, a 36-year-old nurse in Queens. 
2361	Night fell over the Sure Shot, and Wednesday night rolled into Thursday morning. 
2362	Their fishing complete, Dr. Moy and his friend were on their way back to the marina, about an hour from the yacht club. 
2363	Then, just after midnight, a distress beacon on Dr. Moy’s yacht sounded its alarm from 25 miles off the coast of Fire Island. 
2364	The Coast Guard quickly dispatched pilots who spotted an oil slick, a floating white cooler and a lone man — Mr. Wong, the nurse. 
2365	But Dr. Moy, who had transcended humble roots to become a physician treating thousands of patients and then become the subject of a sprawling criminal investigation, had disappeared. 
2366	Two months later, prosecutors and people who knew him are still trying to understand what happened out there on the open ocean. 
2367	Friends from the marina had theories; Mr. Wong, the last man known to have seen him, provided an inconclusive account. 
2368	The judge overseeing his case issued a warrant for Dr. Moy’s arrest, citing the possibility that he had not been on the boat at all. 
2369	Federal investigators said their inquiry was ongoing.
2370	“Look, who knows what happened?” said Roland G. Riopelle, a lawyer representing Bradley Pierre, who is accused alongside Dr. Moy in the insurance fraud case. 
2371	“As I sit here now, I have no reason to know one way or the other whether he died in a boating accident or cleverly created a situation that looked like a boating accident and fled.” 
2372	The only thing anyone knew for certain was that Dr. Moy was gone. 
2373	In some sense, Dr. Moy’s career in medicine was launched in the kitchen of a busy Chinatown restaurant called Mee Sum Cafe. 
2374	His father, Donald Moy, a Chinese immigrant whose family had settled on nearby Mott Street, had owned it since taking it over from his own parents.Marvin, still a boy, became a lackluster student after his parents divorced, he explained years later in a 2021 story about the cafe , written by a student at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism and published on Medium. 
2375	“I just wasn’t interested in things,” he said. 
2376	But a single day’s work as a dishwasher in Mee Sum was clarifying: The family business was not for him. 
2377	He buckled down and became a disciplined student who went on to attend New York University and medical school in Buffalo. 
2378	He graduated in 2004 and returned to New York City, where he opened pain management clinics called Medical Now P.C. in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island. 
2379	In 2007, he met a woman named Hanyue Zhu — she went by Hannah — and they were married less than a year later, in August 2008. 
2380	They settled in a studio apartment on the Upper West Side; soon, Ms. Zhu was pregnant. 
2381	Dr. Moy’s rising fortunes were radically interrupted just four months after his marriage, when he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. 
2382	Surgery in 2009 took a grave toll, with doctors removing a large portion of the organ, turning Dr. Moy into a diabetic. 
2383	He spent two months in a hospital before leaving for home. 
2384	But in his absence, much had changed. 
2385	His version of events is drawn from an affidavit he filed in his divorce case that was obtained by The New York Times. 
2386	Ms. Zhu, reached at her Manhattan apartment, declined to comment for this article.Dr. 
2387	Moy claimed that his pregnant wife had moved her mother into their cramped apartment, forcing him to recover from surgery in Chinatown with his grandparents. 
2388	He felt isolated, even after their daughter was born in 2009. 
2389	He wrote that when Ms. Zhu took the baby to China for a visit, he feared the cancer could return and kill him and the girl “would never know me, her father.” 
2390	He was trying to expand his medical practice, but was low on cash, with lag times of months or even years between filing an insurance claim and finally receiving payment. 
2391	His wife persuaded him, he claimed later, to enter into an agreement with a financial backer called Medical Reimbursement Consultants. 
2392	The partnership with the company and its owner, Mr. Pierre, was the beginning of years of trouble. 
2393	When the Coast Guard rescuers arrived, they quickly pulled Mr. Wong from the sea and into a helicopter. 
2394	He was badly cut about the face but had escaped serious injury. 
2395	Most importantly, he was conscious and appeared lucid. 
2396	He told searchers that the boat had been struck by a much larger vessel and said he had last seen Dr. Moy alive. 
2397	“One individual remains missing and is reportedly wearing a life jacket,” the Coast Guard posted on Twitter. 
2398	News of the incident spread quickly on social media.
2399	“The boat owner is a good friend of mine and one of the nicest guys around,” one person posted on the boating forum TheHullTruth.com. 
2400	Another wrote, “Marvin is a dock mate in my marina, and one of the most competent people and captains.” 
2401	The so-called golden day for rescuing someone at sea is just that — 24 hours. 
2402	Beyond that, water temperature, weather, stamina and other factors make survival far less likely. 
2403	The search for Dr. Wong continued all day Oct. 13 and into Oct. 14. 
2404	The Coast Guard searched more than 4,000 square miles of the ocean surface by Friday afternoon.At 1:03 p.m. on Friday, the Coast Guard posted again on Twitter:“#Update: The search for the missing person has been suspended.” 
2405	A few days later, Dr. Moy’s disappearance was met with skepticism at a court hearing in Manhattan.
2406	“The government requests the court issue a bench warrant,” a prosecutor in the case, Mathew Andrews, said. 
2407	“If Dr. Moy was, in fact, not on the boat.”The judge, Paul G. Gardephe, agreed: “It may well be that Dr. Moy is deceased, but as I understand it, his body has not been recovered, so that leaves open the possibility that he is voluntarily absenting himself from today’s proceeding.” 
2408	Two months later, the lack of evidence has only fueled suspicions.
2409	“The government’s investigation into Dr. Moy’s disappearance is ongoing,” Nicholas V. Biase, a spokesman for the U. S. attorney’s office for the Southern District of New York, said last week. 
2410	“We encourage anyone who may have information as to his whereabouts to please contact this office.” 
2411	But far from Manhattan courtrooms, to the men who know little about the doctor’s legal problems but a lot about his boating skills and habits at sea, his fate is quite clear. 
2412	They’ve spent many hours with Dr. Moy in his boat in all conditions — good and bad, even dangerous. 
2413	And they’re sure they know what happened that night. 
2414	The deal between Dr. Moy and his new business partner worked like this: Medical Reimbursement Consultants would pay Dr. Moy’s practice 35 percent of new claims up front — fast cash immediately instead of a long wait. 
2415	Then, when the insurance company made its payment down the road, Medical Reimbursement Consultants would keep it all. 
2416	At first glance, the arrangement, known as “factoring,” might seem unbalanced. 
2417	But Dr. Moy rationalized that he needed cash, and that most insurance companies, when they paid a claim, usually only paid 70 or 80 percent anyway. 
2418	Throughout this arrangement, prosecutors would later charge, Dr. Moy was also engaged in a sprawling plot to draw tens of thousands of car crash victims into his and other doctors’ practices. 
2419	The ringleader of this more than $70 million enterprise, according to a 2022 federal indictment, was Mr. Pierre, the man who was keeping Dr. Moy afloat with his instant 35 percent payouts on outstanding insurance claims. 
2420	In the description of the enterprise in the indictment, people called “runners” bribed hospital workers, 911 dispatchers and police officers to slip them names of people hurt in car crashes. 
2421	The runners then contacted the victims and directed them to Dr. Moy or another clinic in the group. 
2422	The indictment does not identify any of the police officers or dispatchers who are said to have provided information. 
2423	Once the patients arrived at his clinics, Dr. Moy “conducted unnecessary and excessive medical treatments” to drive up the insurance claims, the indictment states. 
2424	The conduct began early in Dr. Moy’s career, prosecutors charged. 
2425	Court records suggest that with the arrival of the criminal charges this year, Dr. Moy turned on Mr. Pierre. 
2426	In three meetings with investigators, Dr. Moy “made damaging admissions to the prosecution team” and told them that in fact, Mr. Pierre ran his medical practice, according to a motion filed by Mr. Pierre’s lawyers seeking a separate trial. 
2427	His wife had filed for divorce years earlier, and Dr. Moy had moved to a separate apartment in the same building, three stories above, where he lived alone. 
2428	By the spring of this year, Dr. Moy was unmoored from his life and routines, unable to practice medicine pending a trial in his case. 
2429	More and more, Dr. Moy sought solace in the one place that seemed unchanged: his boat. 
2430	His father was a fisherman, and had taught his son to love going out to sea. 
2431	“That was his refuge from all this pressure,” said Dr. Moy’s aunt, Fong Moy, 67.His friends at the marina said he generally left his legal problems in the city. 
2432	“You keep your personal stuff to yourself — that’s what he does,” said George Harned, 41, a fisherman and charter boat captain. 
2433	“He’s a doctor, but he’s a fisherman. That’s his passion.” 
2434	Still, the case was taking its toll. 
2435	“He definitely was stressed out,” said one of his oldest friends, John Chase, who also docked his boat at the Moriches marina. 
2436	Soon, the season for tuna would end; more urgently, meetings with his criminal lawyers promised to keep him in the city for extended periods. 
2437	Dr. Moy wanted to get in one more run. 
2438	In October, he reached out to at least four friends with an invitation to join him on the five or six-hour trip to the Hudson Canyon. 
2439	For that type of outing, a crew of four is ideal, with two people awake at all times. 
2440	This was especially important for Dr. Moy. 
2441	His diabetes would, on some trips, sap his energy on the boat, and in these instances, on the long, uneventful stretches in transit at sea, he would go below deck to his cot and nap, leaving the navigating to one or more companions. 
2442	But for this trip, all four friends told him they had other commitments that day and declined. 
2443	So on Oct. 12, a little before 12 p.m., Dr. Moy ventured out with a single crew mate — Mr. Wong, a newcomer to the marina. 
2444	On social media, Mr. Wong had posted photographs going back years of himself sport fishing, suggesting experience on the water. 
2445	Longtime friends of Dr. Moy said they met Mr. Wong only briefly or not at all. 
2446	Only one friend said he had been fishing with him, with a crew in late September, and had come away questioning Mr. Wong’s experience, based on his conduct on board and handling of equipment. 
2447	To the men from the marina, Mr. Wong had a lot of questions to answer. 
2448	He was out of reach, recovering from his injuries at a hospital, but Mr. Harned sent him a text message. 
2449	“Yo u need to come clean,” he wrote. 
2450	Mr. Wong told his version of events.
2451	“I got seasick at the end of the trip and I stopped fishing. Trip ended early,” he wrote, according to screen shots of their exchange. 
2452	He said he fell asleep on a bench and heard no warning: “The impact woke me up and debris were flying everywhere. He told me he was hurt. I tried to call mayday but all electronic were down.”The boat sank with Mr. Wong clinging to the case that holds the boat’s inflatable life raft, and Dr. Moy to a life ring, Mr. Wong wrote: “The last word I heard from him was ‘Max, are you ok?’” Mr. Wong’s texts did not say who was supposed to be awake and at the helm. 
2453	This account, to Dr. Moy’s friends, sounded dubious at best. 
2454	Why didn’t Dr. Moy grab life jackets? 
2455	Why didn’t he try to deploy the life raft? 
2456	Why, if he was last seen floating in a life ring, had he not been found? 
2457	Instead, the doctor’s friends had been considering their own theory — one painfully grim, but an answer to the lingering questions.
2458	“Any offshore trip is a calculated gamble,” said Mr. Chase. 
2459	“You have to be very careful, and bad things can still happen.”That morning, what bad thing happened? 
2460	They wonder whether Dr. Moy, after a long day and night at sea, had returned to his cot below deck and fallen asleep — “Marvin’s signature move,” one friend said. 
2461	The cot is at the very front of the boat, its head tucked in the V shape of the bow. 
2462	If this had happened, Mr. Wong would have been expected to keep watch at the controls. 
2463	But he said in the texts that he was asleep.The boat’s automatic pilot function was likely to have been engaged, with its radar showing what was nearby. 
2464	Had it indicated a nearby ship and gone unheeded? 
2465	Mr. Wong, answering a reporter’s call in November, said, “I’m not going to comment.” 
2466	He did not respond to later text messages. 
2467	If the Sure Shot struck a commercial ship at its cruising speed, the impact would have been instantly devastating. 
2468	The bow would probably have been severely damaged, instantly flooding the cabin where the doctor was known to sleep. 
2469	It is unclear whether a further search for Dr. Moy’s body will be conducted. 
2470	The Coast Guard has told Dr. Moy’s lawyers that he is not considered deceased until its investigation determines as much. 
2471	That investigation remains open. 
2472	A Coast Guard spokesman said that the information provided by the surviving passenger — Mr. Wong — about a collision could not be verified. 
2473	No ship reported striking another vessel in that area that morning. 
2474	Investigators identified three vessels that potentially could have been near enough to have unknowingly struck the much smaller Sure Shot but had not singled out any one. 
2475	And so two worlds are kept waiting. 
2476	In separate courthouses in Manhattan, lengthy criminal and civil cases sit stalled for lack of a defendant. 
2477	After he disappeared, Dr. Moy’s car sat in the marina’s parking lot for days, until a relative arrived and drove it away. 
2478	The slip where he kept his boat remained empty.
2479	Since China dropped its strict “zero Covid” policy, a joke has been making the rounds on social media about the sudden shift.Three men who don’t know each other sit in a prison cell. 
2480	Each explains why he was arrested:“I opposed Covid testing.”“I supported Covid testing.”“I conducted Covid testing.”The joke has yet to be broadly censored. 
2481	It is a sign of just how much the Chinese Communist Party, usually a master of messaging, is struggling to come up with a coherent explanation for the policy shift and a clear directive for what to do with an explosion of cases  now threatening the country’s medical resources.So dizzying was the switch  that even two weeks later, the state’s powerful propaganda and censorship system has yet to catch up to the flood of confusion and criticism seeping through the country’s typically tight internet controls. 
2482	Apart from laying out the new Covid rules, Chinese official media still hasn’t offered much guidance from top leaders on the situation. 
2483	The country’s hundreds of thousands of internet censors, experts say, haven’t gotten guidance on what to allow and what to delete — and may be confused, given that what was blocked a month ago is now official policy. 
2484	Many Chinese have been asking why they put up with years of harsh lockdowns and travel restrictions, only for the leadership to abandon them and allow the virus to spread unabated. 
2485	For China’s leadership, maintaining public trust hinges, in part, on a difficult task: finding a narrative that makes sense of the reversal.In the weeks since “zero Covid” ended, China’s all-encompassing propaganda and censorship machine has fallen into its old routine of deleting negative press  and spreading “positive energy” posts that praise the struggles of individuals and the government. 
2486	But experts said the three-year trauma caused by the stringent pandemic measures and the last-minute U-turn will prove hard for people to quickly move past.
2487	“It will be impossible for everyone to forget completely. Many will remember ‘zero Covid’ deeply and clearly,” said Fang Kecheng, an assistant professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong who studies China’s propaganda. 
2488	However, that may not lead to widespread loss of confidence in the government, he added, noting that “people still have ways to convince themselves that things don’t seem so bad now.”Thus far, propagandists have hewed to past norms in handling the crisis. 
2489	They have avoided excessive mentions of the policy shift, instead emphasizing social stability. 
2490	State media has sympathetically called the situation “stressful” but otherwise portrayed it as a well-orchestrated decision  to overcome a virus that is no longer as deadly as it once was.Across the country, an acute shortage of medicine , videos of people crowding hospitals, and long lines outside crematories and funeral homes marked a stark contrast with the seven deaths reported by the government this week. 
2491	On Tuesday, the health authorities explained that only deaths caused by coronavirus-induced pneumonia and respiratory failure would be attributed to Covid. 
2492	Anger soon erupted online, with many accusing the authorities of double standards based on their frequent and detailed reports of Covid death statistics from overseas, particularly Europe and the United States. 
2493	Many used the hashtag #WhatIsTheCriteriaForDeathByCovid in complaints on Tuesday. 
2494	By Wednesday, censors had begun to block such posts. 
2495	People wrote about their relatives’ deaths, urging others not to trust propaganda that Covid is now like a flu. 
2496	A blood bank appealed to college students for urgent donations. 
2497	Cancellations of travel reservations for the upcoming Chinese New Year holiday surged as people decided to stay home. 
2498	State media coverage of the country’s top leadership has steered clear of the ongoing outbreak. 
2499	On Monday, a commentary  on People’s Daily justified the new policy, saying it will bring about a “significant positive effect” on economic recovery. 
2500	While the piece said “a lot of work is to be done,” it stopped short of acknowledging the chaos it created.In some ways, the approach is similar to the one taken during the initial outbreak of the virus in Wuhan nearly three years ago. 
2501	At the time, even as the crisis intensified, official Communist Party mouthpieces emphasized the government’s control of the situation and avoided content that could would trigger alarm. 
2502	China’s leader, Xi Jinping, disappeared from the public spotlight  to insulate himself from potential criticism. 
2503	Once the virus was contained, Mr. Xi appeared in the city triumphant. 
2504	This time, it may take longer for Chinese officials to regain the message over a medical crisis driven by a virus that has, in large countries like India and the United States, killed by the hundreds of thousands as waves of illness have overwhelmed medical facilities. 
2505	Aside from general comments about coordinating Covid prevention measures, Mr. Xi has remained silent. 
2506	He has said nothing directly about the recent surge in cases. 
2507	For now, experts said, both the censors and the propaganda officials appear to be scrambling to figure out what to do. 
2508	“I don’t think I’ve seen a planned or orchestrated propaganda plan coming out. It’s more because the general direction has changed, so the propaganda has to follow suit suddenly,” said Mr. Fang. 
2509	One major test will come when the virus spreads to smaller, rural areas with insufficient medical resources, he said. 
2510	A small but vocal chorus online has called out the abrupt and disjointed policy changes. 
2511	Asong Yu, a 30-year-old finance worker in northeastern China, has questioned in sardonic and indirect ways the sudden changes and the lack of explanation.In one post, Mr. Yu shared a response from viral A.I. powered chatbot, ChatGPT, to the prompt, “are there pigs that can do a 180?” 
2512	He had particular vitriol for those he called “epidemic prevention enthusiasts,” nationalists who had previously parroted the government’s position on “zero Covid,” only to be jilted by Beijing’s about-face. 
2513	Online he called them: “abandoned dogs being beaten by their owners.” “The previous propaganda is completely opposite to the current one. I think, however stupid some people might be, they will have to wake up,” Mr. Yu said in an interview. 
2514	So far, Mr. Yu’s posts have avoided the censors’ knife. 
2515	In part, that’s because there are no obvious ways to deal with such a major about-face. 
2516	Censors must decide whether to delete some portion of official posts supporting “zero Covid” for years and how much to tolerate a new zeal for the lifting of lockdowns. 
2517	Some people online have already encouraged others to go out and get Covid to build up immunity. 
2518	Some college students, for instance, have lamented their inability to catch it over the past month, worrying that they will get sick during graduate school entrance exams scheduled this week. 
2519	The sudden change in China’s policy has created chaos and confusion among the tech companies that hire their own censors, and the accounts supporting the party that toe the official line, said Eric Liu, a former censor for Weibo and now an analyst at China Digital Times, a news website tracking censorship in China. 
2520	“I have yet to see a very clear, hardhanded censorship order, so I think it has something to do with the chaos that they are contradicting themselves,” Mr. Liu said, pointing out that most likely Beijing has not figured out an official narrative. 
2521	That, in turn, has prevented the Cyberspace Administration of China, the country’s internet regulator, from issuing uniform orders to censors. 
2522	“A regulated narrative will definitely happen, but we don’t know when it will happen,” he said.
2523	PHOENIX — Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona agreed on Wednesday to tear down a makeshift border wall built out of old shipping containers , ending a divisive border security effort that sparked protests and legal challenges. 
2524	The agreement came as part of a lawsuit filed last week by the Biden administration against Mr. Ducey, a Republican. 
2525	The federal suit sought to force the governor to remove hundreds of steel shipping containers he had ordered stacked up for miles along Arizona’s southern border in response to what he called Washington’s failure to resolve a migrant crisis. 
2526	The Biden administration argued that Mr. Ducey’s wall was constructed illegally on federal land.The agreement to remove the containers comes as border town officials and thousands of migrants at the U.S. border with Mexico are waiting anxiously  to see whether the United States will soon end a pandemic-era policy known as Title 42 that has allowed for the rapid expulsion of migrants. 
2527	Since August, construction crews have hauled old shipping containers to plug gaps in the border fence along a busy migrant corridor in the farm town of Yuma, but have also hauled them to a remote stretch of the Coronado National Forest in southeast Arizona that sees scant migrant crossings compared with other parts of the border. 
2528	The project, funded by the Republican-controlled State Legislature, has cost at least $82 million, Mr. Ducey’s office said. 
2529	In addition to trespassing on federal land, the government accused Arizona of damaging vegetation and seasonal streams in a national forest. 
2530	It sued Arizona last week to dismantle the wall.  
2531	The agreement signed on Wednesday between the governor’s office and federal officials was reached to prevent Washington from seeking a restraining order against the state, according to court records. 
2532	C.J. Karamargin, a spokesman for Mr. Ducey, said the governor had agreed to remove the hundreds of double-stacked shipping containers because federal officials were taking steps to build new permanent barriers to fill in gaps in the existing border wall.
2533	“We’ve said from the very beginning that the shipping container program is temporary,” Mr. Karamargin said. 
2534	“We’ll happily remove them if the federal government gets serious and does what they’re supposed to do, which is secure the border. We now have indications that they’re moving closer, that they’re more serious.” 
2535	The Homeland Security Department announced in July that it would close four gaps in the existing wall in Yuma, as record numbers of migrants have arrived at the southern border, many surrendering to Border Patrol officers to pursue asylum claims. 
2536	It was unclear when crews would begin dismantling Mr. Ducey’s container wall, or how much it would cost to remove the 9,000-pound boxes and repair environmental damage done after bulldozers cut roads, blocked streams and uprooted oaks and junipers. 
2537	In Arizona, some Republican sheriffs and local officials in border towns praised the governor, who leaves office next month, for taking border security into his own hands in defiance of the federal government. 
2538	But critics, including Mr. Ducey’s incoming Democratic successor, Katie Hobbs, called the border wall a waste of taxpayer money. 
2539	Russ McSpadden, the southwest conservation advocate for the Center for Biological Diversity, said he was heartened by the news.
2540	“Governor Ducey has wasted countless millions of taxpayer dollars building his damaging and illegal shipping container wall,” Mr. McSpadden said in a statement. 
2541	“Nevertheless, we’re very pleased to see him agree to remove his political stunt.” 
2542	For weeks over the last month, Mr. McSpadden joined other activists and neighbors upset about the project in gathering in the national forest. 
2543	They set up a protest camp and managed to halt construction by standing in front of bulldozers.
2544	One of the worst things that can happen to a politician is that someone will write about you in the newspaper. 
2545	The most recent example: On Monday, The New York Times reported  that Representative-elect George Santos appears to have misrepresented staggeringly large portions of his résumé.
2546	Mr. 
2547	Santos, who is due to be sworn in next month to represent a New York district that includes parts of Long Island and Queens, appears to have made false claims about his education, employment history and the operation of an animal rescue charity. 
2548	He talked on Twitter about being a landlord but does not appear to own property in New York City or Nassau County, according to the Times reporters’ review of property records and financial disclosures. 
2549	He even claimed four of his employees died in the Pulse nightclub mass shooting in Orlando, Fla., but Times reporters could not find any public connections between any of the victims and his reported companies. 
2550	(His lawyer said that the reporters “are attempting to smear his good name with these defamatory allegations.”) 
2551	This pattern of apparent deception raises serious questions about his sudden possession of enough wealth to self-fund a campaign.But the even bigger question is: How did no one catch this until now? 
2552	Didn’t anyone do any opposition research on this guy? 
2553	Didn’t reporters look into him before the election? 
2554	What happened here? 
2555	It will probably be impossible to determine definitively. 
2556	But my answer is that if you look closely, Democrats did do the basic outlines of this opposition research, just not enough for the full picture to come into view. 
2557	In the end, many people missed the biggest story about him: that he may be a serial fabulist. 
2558	Instead, Democrats emphasized a different story about Mr. Santos, for reasons that make a lot of sense. 
2559	To lay my cards on the table: I was not involved in this race, nor did I do political work at any level in New York this past cycle. 
2560	But I do have 12-odd years of experience doing opposition research for Democrats, so hopefully I am qualified to offer a response.Let’s go through the opposition research process. 
2561	A junior researcher is tasked to write a “book” — a comprehensive report laying out a buffet of opposition research attacks on a given opponent. 
2562	Then a senior researcher oversees and edits the book. 
2563	As the Democratic candidate was not chosen until Aug. 23 in a district Democrats won comfortably in 2020 , this process probably started late and was rushed.Think back to that animal-rescue nonprofit, which reportedly was not registered as a charity. 
2564	How did Mr. Santos get away with that unnoticed? 
2565	He didn’t, exactly. 
2566	We have a copy of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s research book on Mr. Santos, polished for public consumption and posted online  in August. 
2567	Sure enough, we see that Mr. Santos’s charity is documented as unfindable in an I.R.S. database. 
2568	Documented, too, are evictions during the 2010s and instances of undisclosed personal finances that appear in the Times story. 
2569	They’re in small sections interspersed through a nearly 90-page document, yet they’re there. 
2570	Maybe given more time, the researchers could have gone further to confirm the nonprofit’s lack of state filings or could have contacted his former landlords. 
2571	What about Mr. Santos’s apparently lying about his employers and education? 
2572	The Times reported that Baruch College could not confirm that he graduated in the year he claimed, and companies he has listed, such as Goldman Sachs and Citigroup, found no record of his employment. 
2573	Often, opposition research is the dark art of searching databases and copying and pasting information so you can write prompts for reporters. 
2574	You’d be shocked to know what a 20-something given enough time and direction can find out about a person. 
2575	But oppo researchers are not private investigators, and it’s helpful to consider their sources. 
2576	During their work, a researcher may notice there’s not a single piece of evidence outside of the candidate’s own claims about his or her history. 
2577	So how do you verify? 
2578	There are sources like yearbooks and services used by employers for education checks, or you can always try asking politely. 
2579	Employers and universities are under no requirement to share this information with anyone who calls — including a random person asking for the sake of political research. 
2580	(Though I stress: The odds are better than you think if you ask.) 
2581	An alternative solution is to bug newspaper reporters to ask those questions and hope their paper’s reputation compels an answer. 
2582	Reporters asking questions is what happened to Mr. Santos, as employers and schools spoke with The New York Times. 
2583	Whether anyone else tried to this extent before, we don’t know. 
2584	Certainly this story shows why researchers — and reporters — should kick the tires on even small claims by a candidate.Let’s return to the research process: After a book is completed, communications staff members, campaign officials and consultants are briefed on the best hits the researchers could find for pitching to reporters and for advertising purposes. 
2585	We can see one outcome of those briefings in a research-packed news release from the D.C.C.C. that blasted Mr. Santos as a “shady Wall Street bro.” 
2586	Specifically, it highlights the absence of the nonprofit in the I.R.S. database and his previously undisclosed personal finances. 
2587	It’s not the exact story, but months ago, a Democratic operative had the thought to call him “untrustworthy.” 
2588	Then what happened? 
2589	The D.C.C.C. research department probably moved on to the next project. 
2590	This year, as they do every two years, Democrats competed in hundreds of House races. 
2591	The junior staff member may even be moved to a position at a technically distinct division and be legally unable to communicate with his or her former co-workers. 
2592	That’s how some lines of inquiries never progress beyond PDF files.Gently, however, I would suggest that the rest of the prepared Democratic research is quite compelling. 
2593	Mr. Santos claimed he was at the Ellipse at the Stop the Steal rally in Washington, claimed in a video captured by trackers to have assisted with legal fees for Capitol rioters and said he supported  a national abortion ban. 
2594	Heavy stuff! 
2595	That’s along with your standard politically toxic Republican agenda of cutting taxes for the rich while pursuing some form of partial privatization for Social Security.We’re waiting for the final data, but Republicans probably carried this New York district for governor and senator. 
2596	And that’s despite Senator Chuck Schumer’s spending $41 million  to his opponent’s $545,000 statewide. 
2597	Perhaps a stronger attack on Mr. Santos as a possible fraud would have allowed his Democratic opponent to escape such gravity. 
2598	Could Mr. Santos’s opponent and Democratic operatives have pursued this story harder and found out much more? 
2599	I can imagine why that didn’t happen: We’re talking about what appeared to be résumé embellishment, evictions and legal liabilities. 
2600	These are not always shocking things on their own in politics; it’s the extent of Mr. Santos’s apparent false claims that’s highly unusual.The message Democrats chose instead whiffed across New York, but it took the party to a historically strong midterm cycle nationally. 
2601	When the only thing you don’t get more of on a campaign is time, what are you going to spend it talking about?

2607	WASHINGTON — Before Donald J. Trump became president and after, his exceedingly complex and voluminous tax returns came under regular scrutiny by the Internal Revenue Service. 
2608	The number of agents assigned to the audit team: one.After he left office, the I.R.S. said it was beefing up the audit team, to three. 
2609	The tax agency itself acknowledged that it was still overwhelmed by the complexity of Mr. Trump’s finances and the resistance mounted by the former president and his sophisticated army of accountants and lawyers, which included a former I.R.S. chief counsel and raised questions  early last year about why even three revenue agents should be assigned to audit him.
2610	“With over 400 flow-thru returns reported on the Form 1040, it is not possible to obtain the resources available to examine all potential issues,” I.R.S. agents said of Mr. Trump’s tax returns in an internal memo that was released by the House Ways and Means Committee  this week as part of its oversight of the mandatory presidential audit process.The I.R.S. is a sprawling agency, and an audit notice can strike fear in most taxpayers. 
2611	But the committee reports released this week highlight how depleted the I.R.S. has become  in the last decade, as Republicans starved it of funding. 
2612	They also show how the agency has become increasingly unable to crack down on wealthy taxpayers who push the legal limits to lower their tax bills and have the means to fend off audits if they get caught.That has led to a $7 trillion “tax gap ” of revenue over a decade that is owed but goes uncollected, in many cases from superrich taxpayers such as Mr. Trump, who has boasted that he fights to pay as little tax as possible. 
2613	But the resource shortfall is playing out against the backdrop of a partisan and ideological battle over the I.R.S. that appears sure to continue to constrain its ability to match the capacity of an industry dedicated to tax minimization and avoidance.The agency’s work force of about 80,000 is the same size as it was in 1970. 
2614	Its enforcement staff has fallen by over 30 percent since 2010, and audits of millionaires have declined by more than 70 percent. 
2615	Its budget has declined by nearly 20 percent , when accounting for inflation, during the last decade. 
2616	Republicans have for years accused the I.R.S. of political bias and unfairly targeting conservatives. 
2617	For that reason, they have fought to cut the agency’s funding or, in some cases, called to abolish it altogether.The spending package that Congress is voting on this week  reduces the base funding levels for the I.R.S. by $275 million to $12.32 billion, which Republicans hailed as a victory. 
2618	However, that does not account for the $80 billion in supplemental funding that the I.R.S. was granted through the Inflation Reduction Act this year to buttress its resources over the next decade and hire more than 80,000 agents and staff members. 
2619	The Biden administration has broad discretion over how and when to deploy that money to modernize the agency and bolster its enforcement capacity. 
2620	The Treasury Department, which oversees the I.R.S., is planning to use some of those funds to hire more auditors who can tackle complicated tax returns. 
2621	Charles P. Rettig, who was appointed as I.R.S. commissioner by Mr. Trump and left the post last month, has denied any involvement in the audits of the former president. 
2622	But he suggested in an email to The New York Times that the additional funding the agency is receiving will help it undertake such complex examinations.
2623	“I.R.S. desperately needs additional specialized examiners and related support to conduct additional meaningful examinations of complex individual returns involving partnerships and tiered arrangements of partnerships and similar pass-through entities, foreign transactions, complex financial arrangements and similar,” Mr. Rettig said. 
2624	He added that “many decisions within the I.R.S. have long been resource driven.” 
2625	The funds for the I.R.S. are expected to become one of the first big fights in Congress next year when Republicans take control of the House, as Representative Kevin McCarthy, the California Republican who is seeking to become speaker, signaled in September.
2626	“On that very first day that we’re sworn in, you’ll see that it all changes,” Mr. McCarthy said. 
2627	“Because on our very first bill, we’re going to repeal 87,000 I.R.S. agents. Our job is to work for you, not go after you.” 
2628	In November, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, made clear that Republicans believe that a bulked-up I.R.S. is a political liability for Democrats.
2629	“I think we ought to fight an epic, knock-down, drag-out fight over stopping the Democrats from funding 87,000 new I.R.S. agents to harass and intimidate and persecute Americans and their political enemies.” 
2630	Democrats are also doubling down on the findings. 
2631	Representative Richard E. Neal, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, has introduced legislation that would require the I.R.S. to publish presidential tax returns, audit them “in a timely manner” and update the public on the results. 
2632	The House passed the legislation on Thursday, though it appears to have little prospect of passage by the Senate.The Biden administration has emphasized its ambitions of modernizing the antiquated technology at the I.R.S. and improving its customer service. 
2633	In an August memo laying out how the money would be deployed , Treasury Secretary Janet L. Yellen said the agency would be focused on cracking down on rich tax dodgers and big companies that have long evaded paying what they owe to the federal government. 
2634	She also promised that middle-class households would not face more onerous scrutiny and that their audit rates would not rise.
2635	“These investments will not result in households earning $400,000 per year or less or small businesses seeing an increase in the chances that they are audited relative to historical levels,” Ms. Yellen wrote. 
2636	“Instead, they will allow the I.R.S. to work to end the two-tiered tax system, where most Americans pay what they owe, but those at the top of the distribution often do not.” 
2637	The revelations about Mr. Trump’s audits laid bare the difficulty that the I.R.S. has had in auditing the rich. 
2638	The former president proved to be particularly uncooperative, as his team failed to provide facts needed to resolve certain issues and threatened to protest or appeal the process.The process of auditing Mr. Trump apparently even grew contentious. 
2639	An internal I.R.S. memo detailed by the committee said, “There has been some animosity between our counsel and taxpayer’s counsel.” 
2640	The report suggested that as the I.R.S. tried to work its way through Mr. Trump’s maze of tax returns, revenue agents appeared to take for granted that the assertions made by Mr. Trump’s accounting firm were true. 
2641	Michael J. Graetz, the deputy assistant secretary for tax policy at the Treasury Department from 1990 to 1991, said the acquiescence of the I.R.S. to big accounting firms was striking. 
2642	“Any return with that degree of complexity and those dollars at stake is going to be prepared by professionals, and so if that was the Good Housekeeping seal of approval, then there would be very little need to be auditing those kinds of returns,” Mr. Graetz said. 
2643	But it was clear from the committee report that for the most part, the I.R.S. was just outgunned. 
2644	An agency memo that was recounted in the report described an audit team manager laying out the daunting nature of Mr. Trump’s returns. 
2645	“This return has about 400 flow-through returns reported on Schedule E and, since some of these are tiered, report a total of about 500 flow-through returns,” the auditor said.Underscoring the need for more resources, the memo went on to say that to “do a thorough review of these returns, we would need a team much larger than the current team.”
2646	There is a coziness to “Living,” despite the fact that it revolves around death. 
2647	It’s not a holiday movie, at least not explicitly, but like “A Christmas Carol” and other Yuletide ghost stories, it’s a film that steps back to consider the rituals and routines we perpetuate, the ways we’ve changed since the last break. 
2648	And the ways we haven’t.
2649	“Living,” directed by Oliver Hermanus from a screenplay by the novelist Kazuo Ishiguro, is an adaptation of Akira Kurosawa’s drama “Ikiru”  (or “To Live”). 
2650	That Japanese classic from 1952 stars the great Takashi Shimura as a drab Tokyo functionary who learns he is terminally ill and begins to question his life. 
2651	Ishiguro has called “Ikiru” a formative work for him. 
2652	His books (which include “Never Let Me Go” and “The Remains of the Day”) limn the crisis of confronting one’s own life with newfound clarity, of perceiving the ways in which it is fraught and one’s complicity in its corruption. 
2653	With “Living,” Ishiguro — a British writer whose parents moved the family from Nagasaki to Surrey when he was five — infuses his beloved parable with nostalgia closer to home.
2654	“Living” transposes “Ikiru” to a gloomy postwar London filled with buttoned-up men of dignity; bowler-hat-wearing worker bees who commute in and out of the city with the solemn demeanor of churchgoers. 
2655	One of them is Williams (Bill Nighy), a cadaverous bureaucrat and the intimidatingly austere head of the Public Works Department. 
2656	The film opens on a new hire’s first day, but the young man’s illusions are quickly dashed when his new boss, a total gentleman at first glance, proves to be an inert leader. 
2657	A group of women with a petition asking for the construction of a new playground are kicked around the building — this is under that department’s jurisdiction, no, that  one — because no one wants the hassle.Thinking of Nighy and holiday releases, Williams is the total inverse of Billy Mack, the washed-up rocker whom Nighy played in “Love Actually.” 
2658	Where Mack is lovably sleazy, the creaky Williams is inhibition personified. 
2659	The chipper Margaret (Aimee Lou Wood), the sole female employee of Williams’s wing, calls him “Mr. Zombie.” 
2660	When Williams’s doctor tells him he only has a few months to live, his subdued response is both devastating and absurd: “Quite,” he mutters. 
2661	As with the protagonist of “Ikiru,” Williams is transformed by the news. 
2662	First, he turns to a local bohemian, Sutherland (Tom Burke), for a boozy tour of the city’s nightlife. 
2663	Then he spends time with Margaret, a lively companion who gets him in trouble with his son and daughter-in-law, who are convinced the old man is having an affair. 
2664	Eventually, he finds something to believe in, and alters his legacy in the process. 
2665	At its worst, “Living” wallows generically, employing an overbearing piano score as the camera repeatedly sits with Williams’s sadness to diminishing effect. 
2666	Though, captured by the cinematographer Jamie D. Ramsay, there’s also a warmth and twinkle to Williams’s existential plight; as in a David Lean movie, passion mingles elegantly with repression, and Williams emerges as a kind of romantic figure, a man shocked, then delighted, by the thrill of finding himself.Living Rated PG-13 for morbidity and scenes of drunken revelry. 
2667	Running time: 1 hour 42 minutes. 
2668	In theaters.
2669	I wrote  in 2019 that Donald Trump ascended to folk hero status among the people who liked him, which meant that his lying, corruption, sexism and grift not only did not damage him, they added to his legend. 
2670	The folk hero is transcendent. 
2671	He defies convention and defies gravity — in Trump’s case, political and cultural gravity. 
2672	He overcomes the impossible, wins the improbable, evades authority. 
2673	He was a classic trickster figure, common in folklore. 
2674	For instance, for a Black child growing up in the American South, Stack-O-Lee (or, among other variations, Stagger Lee, as we pronounced it) was a folk hero. 
2675	“Stack” 
2676	Lee Shelton was a Black man, a pimp, who in 1895 shot another man dead for snatching his hat. 
2677	The story became the subject of so-called murder ballads. 
2678	Shelton bolstered his legend when, after being released from prison, he killed another man during a robbery.This man, this figure, who negotiated the space between slavery and freedom, between criminal and hero, “came to personify the collective feeling of blacks at the bottom of society, and it was in this sense that Stagolee became a symbol of the Black community,” as Cecil Brown wrote in his book “Stagolee Shot Billy.”Writing in Mother Jones in 2011, Joe Kloc described how Stack-O-Lee became a hero in Southern Black society by unapologetically breaking its rules. 
2679	The murders he committed “only serve to illustrate the injustices of southern society,” Kloc wrote. 
2680	“For all the myth surrounding him, there is something very rational about Stack-O-Lee’s character: Why follow some of society’s rules when so many others work against you?” 
2681	This is why I so instinctively understood Trump’s appeal and heroizing. 
2682	Years, decades, of twisted propaganda had turned working-class white people into a victimized class. 
2683	These white people saw themselves as the new Negro, in a turned-tables alternate reality. 
2684	Society’s rules threatened to — or, had already begun to — work against them. 
2685	Trump, the trickster and rule-breaker, emerges as an amalgamation of their anxieties and rebellion. 
2686	He was a politician, but to them, above politics. 
2687	The Donald was approaching deity. 
2688	His followers embraced a cultish zealotry. 
2689	But things have changed.Trump’s announcement of a third run for the White House landed with a thud. 
2690	High-profile Republicans have refused to sign on as early endorsers. 
2691	Trump himself is cloistered at Mar-a-Lago, having not held a single public campaign event since his announcement. 
2692	In fact, he has been reduced to the low and laughable position of personally hawking digital trading cards of himself. 
2693	(Trump has always seen his die-hard supporters as customers to whom he could sell a product, whether a candidacy or a card.)And a recent poll  showed that Republican and Republican-leaning voters, at least at this point, prefer Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida to Trump by double digits. 
2694	So, what happened? 
2695	In short, God bled. 
2696	And once you see God bleed, you can no longer believe that someone is God. 
2697	It is impossible to overstate how damaging the results of the midterms were, not just to Republicans, but to Trump himself. 
2698	For years, Trump had been able to blame losses or defeats on other people, or even recast them as victories. 
2699	Even though the Robert Mueller report was damning in many ways and went out of its way not to exonerate Trump, the fact that no charges were brought against Trump left him with the opening to claim total vindication. 
2700	He wasn’t disgraced as much as a victim of a politically motivated plot. 
2701	Impeachment, he told his supporters, driven by my political enemies, had twice failed to remove me. 
2702	He wasn’t the most flawed president, but the most resilient.When Trump lost in 2020, he blamed corruption and a stolen election. 
2703	That, of course, was another lie. 
2704	According to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the 2020 election was “the most secure in American history,” and “there is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.” 
2705	Nevertheless, Republican state legislatures across the country used Trump’s election fraud lie as a rationale to “fix” election systems that weren’t broken, to implement even more oppressive voting restrictions. 
2706	But there was an unintended consequence: By boasting about making their electoral processes more secure, Republicans took away whatever latitude they had to lie about elections being stolen when they lost. 
2707	And, in the midterms, they lost some major races, including in states that had implemented the most regressive voter laws, like Georgia and Arizona, where Democrats handily dispatched Trump’s anointed candidates. 
2708	There was no way to wiggle out of the devastating truth of the cycle: The Trump brand was too tarnished and toxic to win in many battleground states. 
2709	He was no longer able to defy political gravity. 
2710	At the same time, Trump’s legal losses are mounting as multiple investigations close in on him. 
2711	The man many had compared to Teflon is beginning to appear more like fly paper. 
2712	Where some Republicans once saw invincibility, they now sense weakness and injury. 
2713	And in the pack mentality of politics, this is the moment that they are most likely to turn on him.The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

2718	HALEIWA, Hawaii — Twenty years ago, Keala Kennelly donned a competition jersey and paddled out to the celebrated waves of Pipeline on the North Shore of Oahu, the heart of surfing’s seven-mile mecca. 
2719	It turns out, she was surfing in the future. 
2720	Back then, women surfing Pipeline, a reef break producing huge waves, stuck out like sore thumbs. 
2721	There had been women who took to the break in previous decades — Joyce Hoffman and Jodie Cooper among them — but Kennelly was still one of few. 
2722	There were no major competitions for professional female surfers at Pipeline. 
2723	And Kennelly’s surf wasn’t for a competition either. 
2724	It was for the 2002 film “Blue Crush.” 
2725	In this aspirational reality, a major women’s surf competition was happening at Pipeline. 
2726	Casting directors looked to some of the world’s best female surfers, including Kennelly and Rochelle Ballard, for the roles of a lifetime.
2727	“It had been a dream of mine to have a legit women’s event at Pipeline,” Kennelly said in Honolulu before mid-December’s Vans Pipe Masters tournament. 
2728	“To make a simulated one, it felt real. It’s like I was living my best life. I was living my dream.” 
2729	The dream was too good to be true at the time. 
2730	It would take almost two decades for Kennelly and Ballard to witness the event they had portrayed happen in reality. 
2731	But twice this year, they watched a group of female athletes compete at the highest level in the waves of Pipeline. 
2732	And it wasn’t for a movie.The evolution in the surfing world comes amid a wave of progress in women’s sports at the highest levels. 
2733	In 2019, the World Surf League, surfing’s organizing body, began awarding equal prize money to its men’s and women’s athletes. 
2734	In 2020, the W.N.B.A. and its players union agreed on a collective bargaining agreement that increased salaries and provided new maternity benefits. 
2735	In May, U.S. Soccer and its top men’s and women’s players  agreed to landmark deals that guaranteed equal pay and shared World Cup prize money. 
2736	But look no further than the surf break that attracts the attention of the entire surfing world to see how deep an opportunity gap can still run in a sport moving toward equality. 
2737	“If I had known it would take a half century to get a contest at Pipe or pay parity, I probably would have given up,” said Patti Paniccia, one of the founders of the professional surfing tour in 1976. 
2738	Paniccia, 70, has spent much of her life fighting for acknowledgment, if not equality, in the world’s best waves.If a surf contest were run in the same location for men and women, Paniccia said, the men’s competition would run in the best wave conditions. 
2739	The women’s contest would be relegated to what Paniccia called “the slop.” 
2740	And while there have been a handful of women’s amateur contests and invitationals held at Pipeline since 2005, surfers issue a quick addendum. 
2741	There’s surfing Pipeline, surfers unanimously explain, and then there’s surfing “real Pipeline.” 
2742	When the waves are breaking just right, the water can hike up like a two-story building some 50 yards from the shore over sharp, shallow reef. 
2743	Catching a wave in those conditions can change a life, or destroy one. 
2744	But there’s a Catch-22 of looking at equity of women’s surfing through a break like Pipeline. 
2745	To master certain waves — especially powerful, technical waves — surfers need to spend a significant amount of time training in those spots. 
2746	Pipeline is not learned in a few sessions. 
2747	And since the women’s professional surfing tour has not included a contest at Pipeline, many top surfers simply did not prioritize training there. 
2748	The wave is of great ancestral importance to Native Hawaiians, and respect must be paid and earned. 
2749	When paddling out to Pipeline, surfers need to understand the nuances in the environment and their place in it, especially when there are some 100 to 150 of the world’s best barrel riders looking to catch the same perfect wave. 
2750	Generations of women have heard the question thrown around the beach. 
2751	Could girls compete at Pipe? 
2752	They wanted to be ready to answer the question in competition unequivocally, when all eyes would be on them. 
2753	Kennelly, a former top surfer on the world tour and one of the world’s top female big-wave surfers, has experience being one of the few women in waves of consequence. 
2754	She had seen how “Blue Crush” sent shock waves across a surf industry that had previously catered to men. 
2755	But she had also seen a lack of progress, and a laundry list of events that did not include women. 
2756	And she still wanted to see a major event at Pipeline.In July 2016, Kennelly co-founded the Committee for Equity in Women’s Surfing with other professional big-wave surfers. 
2757	They explored how local governments could help them in their fight to equalize the sport , and they successfully lobbied California state officials to support the inclusion of a woman’s competition in the big-wave Mavericks surf event.In late 2019, Kennelly turned her focus to Hawaii. 
2758	If the wheels of progress were already in motion toward an event at Pipeline, the encouragement of local government couldn’t hurt. 
2759	In January 2020, the Honolulu City Council unanimously voted to approve a resolution that supported gender equity  in professional surfing. 
2760	“It takes a lot of minor, small, minute shifts for progress to really happen,” said Tyler Wright, a two-time world champion from Australia, in an interview on the shores of Pipeline. 
2761	As Wright, who has spent much of her life at the top of the sport, discussed what equality could look like in professional surfing, she stopped short, distracted by two men who appeared to be stuck in a current. 
2762	“One sec,” she said. 
2763	The 28-year-old Wright grabbed a surfboard and ran some 50 meters to the ocean. 
2764	North Shore lifeguards  were right behind her, and the men were safely on land within minutes. 
2765	“Sorry about that,” she said as she returned. 
2766	Where were we. 
2767	Oh, yes — a women’s place at Pipeline.
2768	“My view of the overall picture is that women’s equality takes a long time because we’re only getting the investment today,” she said. 
2769	Indeed, men have competed at Pipeline since an inaugural contest was held in 1971. 
2770	“Give us 50 years of insane money and equality and access and value and inclusive lineups, and you’ll have a pretty similar product.”In December 2020, after a fatal shark incident involving a recreational surfer at Honolua Bay, Maui, the World Surf League moved its women’s year-end championship tour event to Pipeline. 
2771	The historic move would soon become part of the regular schedule. 
2772	Wright became the first woman to win a championship tour event at Pipeline, defeating the Hawaiian Carissa Moore  in the final heat. 
2773	It was a defining moment for Jessi Miley-Dyer, the chief of sport at the World Surf League. 
2774	“After that competition, I knew that we had to have women at Pipeline,” she said. 
2775	Miley-Dyer, a former professional surfer on the world tour, said the organization had been rebuilding the women’s tour since new ownership took over in 2013. 
2776	“For a lot of people who were watching, and the crew on the beach, it was so emotional to see that come to fruition when you have been looking at it and wanting it for such a long time,” Miley-Dyer said.This year, the World Surf League began hosting its championship tour  at the same spots for men and women. 
2777	Wright has already seen an increase in women paddling out to Pipeline. 
2778	“All that matters is the next generation who are 12 and 5 now see themselves in this lineup,” she said. 
2779	Like Kennelly and Wright and countless other surfers before her, Moana Jones Wong long dreamed of Pipeline as a young girl. 
2780	But she didn’t just dream about surfing it: She wanted to be the first woman to win a proper Pipeline tournament. 
2781	Jones Wong, a 23-year-old North Shore native, describes Pipeline as a character, one that can sense pompous surfers a mile away and quickly introduce them to humility through the reef below the surface. 
2782	Jones Wong speaks like a veteran who has studied the break in and out of the water for much of her life. 
2783	That’s because she has. 
2784	Jones Wong first paddled out when she was 12 years old, battling thoughts that it was “a man’s wave.” 
2785	She was a talented young surfer, and her friends — boys around her age — encouraged her to join them. 
2786	It still was not easy.
2787	“I had this social judgment, like I shouldn’t be out at Pipeline because I’m a girl,” she said. 
2788	“It would prevent me from going out a lot.”She was so drawn to the wave that she would push herself out of her comfort zone, she said, recalling telling herself, “I’m not going to let this social norm that I’m feeling from everybody prevent me from surfing the wave I want to surf.” 
2789	It would take her six years to catch a wave that made her feel like she truly belonged out there.In February, Jones Wong became the first woman to win the Billabong Pro Pipeline , defeating both Wright and the newly minted Olympic gold medalist Moore.Kennelly, who said she was not a crier, watched with tears in her eyes. 
2790	She had been nervous. 
2791	She knew there would be an acclimation process. 
2792	“I needed them to justify what I had done to get them in there — I really needed them to come through,” she said. 
2793	“And I feel like they did.” 
2794	This month, the top men and women returned to the North Shore for the Vans Pipe Masters event. 
2795	The significance of what was happening offshore was not lost onshore.After Moore rode what might have been the best wave of the event , the beach erupted in pandemonium before the heat was even over. 
2796	It was a qualifying round, but no matter. 
2797	This — the women’s competition at “real” Pipeline — was the main event. 
2798	On Dec. 18, Moore, 30, surfed in the finals and was joined by the next generation: 20-year-old Molly Picklum and two 17-year-olds, Bettylou Sakura Johnson and Caity Simmers. 
2799	Picklum won the event, and she was wide-eyed as a gaggle of young girls waited for her autograph.
2800	“All the girls sitting here realizing that Pipe is on the cards for women’s surfing is incredible,” Picklum said, trophy in hand. 
2801	“And I think women’s surfing is only going up really quickly from here.”
2802	Imagine what it’s like to live in a state of perpetual uncertainty — at any moment you could lose your job because you no longer have the right to work legally. 
2803	Picture families ripped apart — a mother sent back to a country she barely remembers, forced to leave her child behind. 
2804	What would you do if the teachers, doctors and nurses in your community were suddenly barred from entering your children’s classrooms or treating your loved ones? 
2805	As someone who is protected by DACA, I think a lot about this.During this lame duck session of Congress, while Democrats still control both chambers, there was an opportunity to keep this scenario from becoming a reality. 
2806	A bipartisan proposal, led by Senators Kyrsten Sinema and Thom Tillis, would have provided a path to citizenship for about two million immigrant youths, including recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. 
2807	But negotiations to include it in the 2023 omnibus appropriations bill  failed. 
2808	This might’ve been the last chance to save DACA. 
2809	The program remains under attack and could be undone by the Supreme Court as early as next year, ripping away work permits and protections from deportation for hundreds of thousands of young people. 
2810	Republicans, readying to seize control of the House in less than two weeks, have already made it clear that they won’t advance legislation that protects undocumented immigrants. 
2811	I first came to Washington in 2010 to fight for the Dream Act, which would have provided a path to citizenship to undocumented people who came to the United States as children. 
2812	I was a college student at Texas A&M University, and I persuaded United We Dream, a nonprofit immigrant advocacy organization, to cover the cost of a bus to transport me and other young undocumented students from Texas to Washington so we could join rallies and meet with elected officials to lobby for the bill. 
2813	When the Dream Act failed to pass, many of us came out more publicly about our immigration status in an effort to pressure President Barack Obama to act. 
2814	Two years later, he signed an executive order to create DACA, a temporary fix that allowed young undocumented immigrants who came to the country as children, as I did from Mexico at age 7, to obtain work permits and protection from deportation if they met certain criteria. 
2815	Today, as executive director of United We Dream, I help to lead our network of undocumented youths all the while knowing I have to live with the same uncertainty, the same inability to plan, without a path to citizenship. 
2816	Last week, I watched as hundreds of United We Dream members, alongside other immigrant youths and allies, descended on Washington from states including Alaska, Arizona, Michigan and North Carolina to urge Congress to act. 
2817	Those young people, who reminded me so much of myself in 2010, filled my spirit with their hope, determination and resilience. 
2818	We have shared our stories, we have held rallies, we have knocked on doors in the middle of a pandemic. 
2819	It breaks my heart that once again Congress has failed us.Our loss of work permits and deportation protections would have far-reaching implications for our country. 
2820	As DACA recipients, we have to renew our status every two years. 
2821	If the program were to end, we would most likely fall out of status on a rolling basis, which means an estimated 1,000 people would lose their jobs  each day for two years.If we lose our right to live and work here legally, we will lose our ability to pay our mortgages, our access to employer-sponsored health insurance and the ability to pay our employees. 
2822	According to the New American Economy Research Fund , DACA-eligible immigrants collectively earn more than $20 billion per year, most of which is either paid out in federal taxes or spent in the economy.We represent some 200,000 essential workers, including nearly 30,000 health care workers who have helped communities across the country get through this pandemic. 
2823	The education profession is among the top careers DACA recipients pursue. 
2824	If the program ends, the field stands to lose 800 DACA-protected professionals per month for two years . 
2825	The end of the program will also bring uncertainty to the over 2.5 million people who live with a DACA recipient.Providing citizenship for immigrant youths has broad support from voters . 
2826	And Democrats in Congress owe their legislative power to Black and brown organizers on the ground in states like Georgia, Pennsylvania and Nevada who have been organizing for years, leading to significant grass-roots support. 
2827	And in Arizona, where they have been fighting back against racist anti-immigrant policies for over a decade. 
2828	Those organizers knocked on doors in 2018, 2020 and 2022 to help Democrats in Arizona win and retain two Senate seats and delivered the state’s Electoral College votes to a Democratic presidential candidate for the first time in over 20 years. 
2829	When I think about the millions of young immigrants, including DACA recipients, who have had to live their lives in a perpetual state of limbo, I am filled with righteous anger, which I channel into action and a discipline of hope that we are working to create the conditions for us to win and to build the futures we deserve. 
2830	We need President Biden and members of Congress to come together and meet this moment with the urgency it requires.

2836	In September the Pew Research Center modeled  four potential futures for American religion, depending on different rates of conversion to and disaffiliation from the nation’s faiths. 
2837	In three of the four projections, the Christian percentage of the U.S. population, which hovered around 90 percent in the 1970s and 1980s, drops below 50 percent within the next half-century. 
2838	In two scenarios, the Christian share drops below 50 percent much sooner, sometime around 2040, and then keeps on falling.This is a potentially epochal transition, but a transition of what kind? 
2839	Toward a truly secular America, with John Lennon’s “Imagine” as its national anthem? 
2840	Or toward a society awash in new or remixed forms of spirituality, all competing for the souls of lapsed Catholics, erstwhile United Methodists, the unhappily-unchurched? 
2841	Ten years ago I published a book called “Bad Religion: How We Became a Nation of Heretics,” which offered an interpretation of the country’s shifting religious landscape, the sharp post-1960s decline of institutional faith. 
2842	Before the book’s anniversary slips away, I thought I would revisit the argument, to see how it holds up as a guide to our now-more-de-Christianized society.What the book proposed was that “secularization” wasn’t a useful label for the American religious transformation. 
2843	Instead, I wrote, American culture seems “as God-besotted today as ever” — still fascinated with the figure of Jesus of Nazareth, still in search of divine favor and transcendence. 
2844	But these interests and obsessions are much less likely to be channeled through churches, Protestant and Catholic, that maintain some connection to historical Christian orthodoxies. 
2845	Instead, our longtime national impulse toward heresy  — toward personalized revisions of Christian doctrine, Americanized updates of the gospel — has finally completed its victory over older Christian institutions and traditions. 
2846	The result is a religious landscape dominated by popular Christian ideas that have “gone mad,” as G.K. Chesterton once put it, “because they have been isolated from each other and are wandering alone.” 
2847	This America has a church of self-love, with prophets like Oprah Winfrey preaching a gospel of the divine self, a “God Within” spirituality that risks making selfishness a virtue. 
2848	It has a church of prosperity, with figures like Joel Osteen as its bishops, that insists that God desires nothing more for his elect than American prosperity, capitalist success. 
2849	And it has churches of politics, preaching redemption through political activism — a Christian nationalism on the right, by turns messianic and apocalyptic, and a progressive utopianism on the left, convinced that history’s arc bends always in its favor. 
2850	These heresies, I argued, are more important to understanding the true influence of religion in America than anything that comes out of the Roman Catholic Church or the Southern Baptist Convention. 
2851	You can understand our spiritual situation more completely by reading “The Da Vinci Code,” “Eat, Pray, Love” and “Your Best Life Now” than by browsing a papal encyclical (or for that matter an atheist polemic). 
2852	And you can see more of Christianity’s enduring but now deformed influence in will.i.
2853	am’s celebrity hymns to Barack Obama in 2008, or Glenn Beck’s right-wing revivals a couple of years later, than in whatever cultural authority still attaches to the New Testament or the Nicene Creed.So ran my case in 2012. 
2854	Ten years gone, has the framework held up? 
2855	In certain ways, obviously so. 
2856	Consider the peculiar phenomenon of Donald Trump, an apparent heathen who somehow managed to seize the leadership of the country’s more religious political party, and then to be treated by some of its more zealous members as a kind of anointed king.Trump’s ascent was a testament to the strength of key heresies — prosperity theology, self-help religion and a jingoistic Christian nationalism — within the religious right. 
2857	Notably, Trump’s main institutional connection to Christianity was his long-ago attendance at Norman Vincent Peale’s church in Manhattan, at the time when Peale was famous as the guru of spiritual self-actualization, the author of “The Power of Positive Thinking.” 
2858	As a celebrity businessman and huckster Trump turned out to be a natural champion for Peale’s more right-wing heirs, gathering in allies from the realm of celebrity pastors and prosperity preachers. 
2859	Meanwhile, as a tribune of American greatness, he ended up appealing to the more nationalist parts of evangelicalism — including voters who were more likely to identify with Christianity as a cultural marker of “American-ness” than to actually attend church.When Paula White-Cain, a TV preacher and self-help author, emerged as a key spiritual adviser to Trump in 2016, the Southern Baptist leader Russell Moore tweeted  that White is “a charlatan and recognized as a heretic by every orthodox Christian, of whatever tribe.” 
2860	If Moore was speaking for orthodoxy against heresy, the Trump era suggested that heresy was the stronger party: White gave the inauguration invocation, Moore became a lightning rod among Southern Baptists for his anti-Trump stance, and the idea that Christian conservatism should have clear moral or doctrinal standards for its leaders passed away. 
2861	While Trumpism was being enabled by heresies of the right, liberalism in the Trump era ended up infused by heresy to a degree that even I didn’t see coming. 
2862	The idea of wokeness didn’t figure in “Bad Religion,” which came out before the new wave of campus activism, before Black Lives Matter and #MeToo and the diversity-equity-inclusion era. 
2863	But the “Great Awokening” is a perfect example of Christian spiritual energies cut loose from orthodox belief — a version of Protestant revivalism stripped of Protestant dogmatics, but retaining a crusading zeal, a rhetoric of conversion and confession and moral transformation, a sometimes-frenzied urge to cast out the evil and unclean. 
2864	Social justice progressivism has many influences, of course. 
2865	But it has to be understood, in part, as a spiritual descendant of Puritanism, occupying the locus of Puritan power (the old Protestant citadels of the Ivy League and the Northeastern establishment), adapting the old spirit of moral perfectionism to a new set of issues and demands. 
2866	So on right and left alike, the nation-of-heretics framework still seems useful. 
2867	But then the question, and the challenge for my thesis now, is exactly how far the decline of Christianity can go before a term like “heresy” stops being analytically appropriate. 
2868	Because at some point, presumably, the influence of Christianity becomes merely genealogical, and you have to credit spiritual experimenters with reaching distinct religious territory. 
2869	A core of Christian practice and belief in this country seems relatively resilient. 
2870	But the idea of a “nation of heretics” assumed a lot of Americans with loose ties to Christianity — Christmas-and-Easter churchgoers, people raised with at least some idea of the faith’s tenets. 
2871	And it’s the loosely-affiliated who have separated most in recent years, further attenuating the connections between Christianity and its possible rivals or successors. 
2872	While wokeness is a variation on the Protestant social gospel, it’s clearly the most-de-Christianized form yet; it’s happy to find allies within the Christian churches, but it’s own spiritual projects are more likely to involve the elevation of indigenous, pre-Christian spiritualities. 
2873	A striking development of the Trump era is the emergence of a self-consciously post-Christian right — a Nietzschean or neopagan tendency, more very online than truly politically significant, but still a non-Christian novelty, and not a welcome one. 
2874	Finally in youth religious culture, mediated by social-media trends that were in their infancy 10 years ago, many more Americans are experimenting with explicitly post-Christian ideas and influences: Astrology, witchcraft, spiritualism, the hallucinogenic quest.When I was writing “Bad Religion” there was still interest in the various “historical Jesus” projects, the scholarly reconstructions that promised to deliver a Jesus better suited the spiritual assumptions of a late-modern United States. 
2875	And it felt like there was a strong cultural incentive to recruit some version of the Nazarene — as Dan Brown did in The Da Vinci Code , for instance — for your personal spiritual project, to gain Jesus’s blessing for leaving Christian orthodoxy behind. 
2876	Today, though, my sense is that Jesus himself is less culturally central, less necessary to religious entrepreneurs — as though where Americans are going now in their post-Christian explorations, they don’t want or need his blessing. 
2877	That shift in priorities doesn’t tell us exactly where they’re going. 
2878	But it’s enough for now to say that the “post-Christian” label fits the overall trend in American spirituality more than it did a decade ago. 
2879	That kind of shift, though, shows the unpredictability of the religious future as much as its inevitability. 
2880	The Pew report, notably, treats a hypothetical “status quo” scenario — nobody changing their religion — as its best case for Christianity’s future in America. 
2881	It doesn’t have a scenario where Christian growth returns, where a larger share of America is Christian in 2050 than today. 
2882	I wouldn’t expect a social scientist to anticipate that kind of reversal. 
2883	But Advent and Christmas aren’t about trends extending as before; they’re about rupture, renewal, rebirth. 
2884	That’s what American Christianity needs now — now as ever, now as in those first days when its whole future was contained in the mystery and vulnerability of a mother and a child.

2890	POMPEII, Italy — On a bright morning in the shadow of Mount Vesuvius, a stout shepherd with a wool sweater stretched over his belly whistled and clicked and steered his flock of sheep to a grassy slope above Pompeii’s frescoed ruins. 
2891	He glanced a few feet down at a house destroyed nearly 2,000 years ago under a fiery rain of volcanic rock and tapped a grazing ewe with his crook to make sure it didn’t get too close and take a tumble. 
2892	“It can happen,” the shepherd, Gaspare de Martino, said with a shrug. 
2893	In recent years, the vast archaeological park of Pompeii, a city buried alive by the eruption of Vesuvius in A.D. 79, has turned to high-tech options to maintain its excavated ruins. 
2894	A surveillance drone makes a monthly flight over the site’s roughly 10,000 exhumed rooms. 
2895	Artificial intelligence programs analyze aerial images for new cracks, fallen stones and other signs of erosion. 
2896	But to prevent the third of the park that remains hidden under pumice and meters of earth from becoming overgrown with thorn bushes, wild hedges and trees, Pompeii has found a more appropriately ancient, and inexpensive, solution in hungry sheep. 
2897	Without the sheep “you’d have some kind of jungle that would invade the archaeological structures and the site,” said Gabriel Zuchtriegel, the park’s director. 
2898	He said that he came up with the idea of bringing in the sheep after seeing them maintain the land on top of dikes in the North Sea, and said that the Pompeii sheep would chomp down invasive vegetation, destructive roots and wild terrains that could lead to the city’s reburial under landslides. 
2899	“They’re stopping the beginning of something,” he said. 
2900	But Mr. Zuchtriegel acknowledged that his new landscaping project, which began a few weeks ago, was as much about reimagining Pompeii’s immediate marketing future as it was about preserving its archaeological past. 
2901	For a city most closely associated with choking clouds of ash and incinerating gusts of heat from one of the most horrific natural disasters in recorded history, the sheep — along with newly planted vineyards, orchards in ancient atriums and plans for local olive oil — are part of a Pompeii Pastoral rebranding campaign to move away from fire and brimstone, and toward farm to table.
2902	“I even dream,” Mr. Zuchtriegel said in German-accented English as the sheep bleated around him, “of wool.” 
2903	Mr. Zuchtriegel is one of the so-called super directors recruited internationally by Italy to modernize major museums. 
2904	He may have visions of a Pompeii-branded farm producing milk, cheese and lamb to be served at a new restaurant overlooking the site and of exclusive scarves and sweaters stacked in a gift shop, but as he points out, the sheep themselves are nothing new for Pompeii.Pliny the Elder, the ancient world’s great naturalist, wrote in his encyclopedic “Natural History” that the region around Pompeii had “fleeces of sheep so handsome.” 
2905	He was less impressed with their brains, asserting that “the fleecy sheep is the stupidest of animals.” 
2906	The volcano’s eruption killed Pliny with “some gross and noxious vapor,” as his nephew, Pliny the Younger, wrote in his own searing account of the disaster. 
2907	In the ensuing centuries, sheep returned and grazed on the earth above the buried city, even after excavation began in the 18th century. 
2908	For generations, the ancestors of Mr. de Martino, including his grandfather and father, led their flock to the park’s unexcavated grounds. 
2909	Only about 15 years ago, he said, did the park management tell him to take a hike.
2910	“We were here forever, but then the old director didn’t let us in anymore,” Mr. de Martino said. 
2911	“They didn’t like the dung. What was I supposed to do, pick up after them?”He hissed commands — “Ishuh, Ishuh” — at his two Belgian Shepherds, Sara and Stellina, and leaned on his crook as the sheep mowed the grass and devoured tall reeds and leaped to bite the berries off bushes. 
2912	“They’ll eat anything.”The night before, Vesuvius, which is still an active volcano, grumbled near its crater with a small earthquake, though experts say not dangerously. 
2913	Mr. de Martino, 40, shook off any concern. 
2914	“When it explodes, it explodes,” he said. 
2915	“You can’t plan these things. You can’t say, ‘Hold on a sec.’” 
2916	He expressed more concern about making a living. 
2917	Between the competition from big agriculture, and the difficulties of finding fields for his flock around busy streets and a maze of private property, he said he had to transition into truck driving. 
2918	“With 151 sheep, how do you live?” he asked.He said Mr. Zuchtriegel’s invitation to return to the unexcavated fields was an opportunity to “get bigger.” 
2919	So far, the sheep seem to be a welcome addition. 
2920	Tourists walking on the labyrinth of ancient roads paved with large stones looked up from their guidebooks at the sound of clanging sheep bells. 
2921	“How do I get up there?” one called to Mr. Zuchtriegel, who stood atop the slope and shook his head no. 
2922	“Prohibited?” the man called back, disappointed.Mr. 
2923	Zuchtriegel has sought to use the sheep to introduce autistic children to the park, believing it creates a more memorable, and authentic, Pompeii experience than a lecture about the four styles of Pompeii wall art. 
2924	“Maybe one day,” Mr. Zuchtriegel said, “we’ll have a thousand sheep or other animals.” 
2925	The maintenance workers who are stationed by the Vesuvius Gate near the livestock’s outdoor stall, which is scattered with fennel, said the more lawn-mowing animals, the merrier.
2926	“If they didn’t do it, we’d have to,” Pasquale Lombardi, 52, said, thankfully. 
2927	Another member of the maintenance crew, Antonio Mariano Siepe, 31, spoke about the potential of the sheep, especially “with roasted potatoes.”The men walked down the Via Vesuvius, which runs alongside the House of Leda , just below the slope upon which the sheep grazed. 
2928	There, they tried to strike up a conversation with Barbara dell’Isola, 28, an art restorer in white scrubs (“What are you up to, Barbara?”) who worked near the sensual fresco of the Spartan queen holding Jupiter, disguised as a swan, on her lap.She thought, at first, that having the sheep work the fields above her while she worked on the walls “was strange.”“I felt like there was danger, that some detritus might fall on the walls,” she said. 
2929	But then she realized that “they only eat.” 
2930	Some of the park’s staff saw the return of the sheep as a kind of return of life to Pompeii, a place, perhaps more than any other, that was synonymous with agonizing death. 
2931	A friendly brown-and-white stray dog followed Maurizio Bartolini, Pompeii’s gardener, as he walked to the fields. 
2932	He said the park’s clean environment and lack of pollution had drawn more wild animals, including hoopoe birds, an owl that took residence above the aristocratic House of Pansa and lots of hedgehogs. 
2933	“The animals have come back to Pompeii,” he said. 
2934	At around 1 p.m., Mr. de Martino sent his dog Sara to start rounding up the sheep, whose incessant ripping at the grass sounded like a heavy rain. 
2935	They made a noisy, pealing parade back through the Vesuvius Gate and down a dirt road outside the park with Mr. de Martino following closely behind. 
2936	Giuseppe Mingo, 59, one of the maintenance workers, watched them go, the ruins at their backs, the volcano looming above their heads. 
2937	“It’s like ancient times,” he said.
2938	I’ve waited in line in Los Angeles for wobbly brisket and tacos and French fries covered in mayonnaise, for chiles rellenos and warm pastries, for fried chicken and ice cream and bagels . 
2939	But on a recent Saturday morning, I waited half an hour for a rainbow sandwich.It was not the kind I remember from college, when I was a vegetarian  — the chilled, on-the-dry-side sandwiches with dense, crumbling breads, stuffed with sprouts on the verge of withering, faintly spotted with discoloration, wrapped a little too tightly so that tomato seeds and browning avocado squelched against the plastic wrap. 
2940	No, this rainbow sandwich was made to order, spread with a blend of sunflower seeds and garlic confit, and packed with cucumbers, beets, carrots and a heap of alfalfa sprouts from the farmers’ market, along with some turmeric-stained fried tofu. 
2941	It was contained in fresh, delicious sourdough.As a whole, it was pleasing, gentle, multicolored and reminiscent of something you might pick up at your neighborhood health food store or a cult-run vegetarian cafe in, say, 1975, or 1985, or 1995 — but better. 
2942	What was it doing here, now? 
2943	Though Zach Jarrett developed it last September for the new restaurant wing of the bakery Bub and Grandma’s , it felt like a sandwich untethered from time. 
2944	A good rainbow sandwich will always seem this way here, as will the closely related, overlapping hippie, avocado and California sandwiches, which take inspiration from a hodgepodge of vintage food obsessions that never really went away, but settled in and evolved. 
2945	The sandwiches may or may not be vegan, but they will almost certainly contain a few different vegetables and sprouts — a great big mass of sprouts, gently compressed to make a crunchy, juicy, intensely green-tasting cushion of delicate floss.Sprouts are an ancient ingredient, but as Jonathan Kauffman writes in his 2019 book, “Hippie Food ,” until the 1970s, only Southern Californians ate raw alfalfa sprouts. 
2946	Alfalfa sprout sandwiches were a local phenomenon, too, and recipes appeared as early as 1953 in promotional cookbooks published by El Molino, an old stone-ground mill operation in Alhambra, Calif., which sold grain and flour to health food shops. 
2947	The best sprout sandwiches are now complex and idiosyncratic, the work of obsessive cooks with a genuine soft spot for the genre. 
2948	Some remember their parents going through a phase of shoving sprouts between dense slices of toasted wheat, but they have enough distance from the American health food trends of the 1970s to think of the sandwiches fondly, and to reimagine them with pleasure in mind.But that early recipe in the El Molino cookbook was plain and straightforward. 
2949	It consisted of two pieces of rye bread spread with mayonnaise, holding a quarter-inch layer of fresh alfalfa sprouts and optional slices of tomato. 
2950	And even here, in the book’s enthusiastic how-to, which taught readers how to start their own sprout supply at home, the authors issued a warning: “It may take a little time to learn to fully appreciate the unique taste.”That kind of hedging has haunted sprouts for decades, as if they required an apology, a defense. 
2951	But sprouts aren’t a novelty, and sprout sandwiches can be their own kind of fragrant, green luxury — their own unlikely indulgence. 
2952	As Mr. Kauffman writes in “Hippie Food,” alfalfa sprouts smell “as if a field of grass were having sex.” 
2953	Mr. Jarrett, of Bub and Grandma’s, said the rainbow was his favorite sandwich on the menu, hands down. 
2954	“It feels really good when you eat it,” he said.Daniel Mattern and Roxana Jullapat knew that they wanted an excellent version of a hippie sandwich on the menu before they even opened Friends and Family , their Thai Town bakery. 
2955	It wasn’t just for their diners, but for themselves and their cooks (among whom it’s a favorite working lunch).
2956	“You can have that sandwich, feel good and fueled, and still keep moving,” Mr. Mattern said. 
2957	“It’s not nap time.” 
2958	Mr. Mattern shuffles a fat slice of salty feta between layers of mashed peas, sliced avocado, cucumber and thick, juicy sunflower sprouts, and the cheese works to season every bite. 
2959	Part of the sandwich’s texture and charm also comes from the grainy, pleasingly close-set bread, which Ms. Jullapat devised just for this sandwich. 
2960	To make it, she adds a compact mash of sprouted grains to a very strong dough of red fife flour, along with sunflower, pumpkin and flax seeds.The version you can find at Wax Paper, a small sandwich shop with two locations in Los Angeles, is particularly magnificent, filled with grated Cheddar, pickled and raw onion, avocado, cucumber, sprouts and garlicky aioli. 
2961	(Peter Lemos, an owner, calls it the “Ira Glass” on the menu; it’s an eccentricity of the shop, where all the sandwiches are named after public radio personalities.)“There are a lot of sprouts here, it’s almost the main ingredient,” Mr. Lemos said. 
2962	“But the sprouts make the sandwich.” 
2963	The quantity of sprouts at Wax Paper cannot be overstated. 
2964	And something happens when sprouts appear in such a huge quantity, far beyond the quarter-inch suggestion in that 1953 recipe: It becomes clear that there’s nothing inherently austere about sprouts, nothing spare or severe or grim. 
2965	En masse, sprouts are quite the opposite, not just a cheerful frill, but an extravagance — succulent and flourishing.

2967	ALBANY, N.Y. — Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York granted clemency to 13 individuals Wednesday, including two prisoners serving murder sentences and a domestic violence survivor sentenced for manslaughter in the death of her abuser. 
2968	All told Ms. Hochul issued nine pardons and four commutations of prison sentences. 
2969	The two inmates whose murder sentences were commuted will have to wait for action by the State Parole Board to be freed. 
2970	Jacqueline Smalls, who was serving a 15-year sentence after stabbing her abuser in the chest, will be promptly released, according to the governor’s office. 
2971	The announcement adheres to a tradition of New York governors using their power to grant clemency during the holiday season. 
2972	Governors have vast power to cut prison sentences short and pardon those who have been convicted of crimes.
2973	“Clemency is a powerful tool that can be exercised to advance the interests of justice and fairness, and to recognize efforts made by individuals to improve not only their own lives but the lives of those around them,” Ms. Hochul said. 
2974	“These grants of clemency serve not only to acknowledge the steps these individuals have taken to rehabilitate themselves, but to remind others that such change is possible and that nobody should be defined by their worst mistake.” 
2975	Ms. Hochul came under fire from criminal justice activists last year, a few months after taking the reins from disgraced former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, for granting a single prison commutation on Christmas Eve. 
2976	She also pardoned nine individuals who completed their sentences, all immigrants facing deportation issues. 
2977	Since taking office Ms. Hochul has adopted reforms to increase transparency in the clemency process and has tapped six experts to serve on a Clemency Advisory Panel. 
2978	After her actions Wednesday, she has 857 applications for commutations and 441 requests for pardons pending, the governor’s office said. 
2979	Steven Zeidman, who as director of the Second Look Project at the City University of New York School of Law supports the use of more aggressive clemency powers by governors, said he’d prefer to see more commutations, but he applauded Ms. Hochul for the ones she issued.
2980	“Politically, these are not easy decisions to make,” Mr. Zeidman said. 
2981	“I think she deserves a great deal of credit.” 
2982	Mr. Zeidman worked on two cases that appeared on Ms. Hochul’s list, both of them involving prisoners serving long sentences for murder who had become model inmates while incarcerated. 
2983	One is Bruce Bryant, who has served more than 30 years of a 37.5-year-to-life sentence for the murder of 11-year-old Travis Lilley, killed by a stray bullet that Mr. Bryant said he never fired. 
2984	Another is Stanley Bellamy, who has served more than 37 years of a 62.5-year-to-life sentence on murder charges stemming from a botched gun sale in Queens in 1985.Had Ms. Hochul not intervened, Mr. Bellamy would have been 85 before becoming eligible for parole, a fate Mr. Zeidman equated to a “death in prison sentence.” 
2985	Ms. Hochul’s commutations mean the two men will be eligible for parole, but the New York State Board of Parole must decide if they will ultimately be released from prison. 
2986	Ms. Hochul also commuted the sentence of Anthony Evans, who has served almost 19 years of a 22-year-to-life sentence for burglary and can expect prompt release. 
2987	Advocates for victims of domestic violence had been urging a commutation for Ms. Smalls, who has served more than 10 years of her sentence. 
2988	She was convicted of manslaughter for stabbing her abuser after he entered her home despite two orders of protection pending against him, according to the governor’s office.
2989	“We are incredibly grateful to Governor Hochul for her longstanding commitment to domestic violence survivors,” said Dara Sheinfeld, head of pro bono litigation at Davis Polk, who assisted Ms. Small’s legal team. 
2990	“This grant is a recognition that, for domestic violence survivors, criminal conduct is often inextricably interwoven with their histories of abuse and trauma.”Pardons are generally granted to individuals convicted of crimes after they have completed all court-imposed requirements, according to the governor’s office . 
2991	Among the nine people Ms. Hochul pardoned Wednesday — all facing deportation proceedings — was Lesly Parfait, 52, a Haitian immigrant who was convicted of third-degree robbery in 2005. 
2992	He faced mandatory deportation next year, his lawyers at the Legal Aid Society of New York said. 
2993	When told of his pardon, Mr. Parfait, a permanent legal resident who was just 5 years old when he came to the United States in 1975, said “I feel like dancing,” said Ted Hausman, a supervising attorney at the Legal Aid Society. 
2994	He said Mr. Parfait lives in Queens and has six children and seven grandchildren.
2995	“This pardon means the world to Mr. Parfait,” Mr. Hausman said. 
2996	“It means that he’s not going to get torn away from his large family.”
2997	As prices rise, higher mortgage payments follow, and after nearly three years of rapid home appreciation during the pandemic, qualifying for a home loan is more difficult than ever. 
2998	Today’s buyers also face the additional cost of rising interest rates.In its most recent quarterly report, HSH.com , a source for national mortgage and home equity rates and news, charted the annual income required to qualify for a mortgage on a median price home in the country’s 50 largest metropolitan areas.The website looked at third-quarter 2022 median sale prices of single-family homes, factoring in the industry-standard 28 percent debt-to-income ratio used to qualify prospective borrowers. 
2999	(A 20 percent down payment and a fixed-rate, 30-year loan at a rate concurrent with the study were assumed; local property taxes and homeowner’s insurance costs were also included.) 
3000	It found that the national median home price was $398,500, requiring a payment of $2,233 a month and a qualifying household income of $95,717 a year. 
3001	The national median household income, about $70,000 a year, puts this out of reach for most households. 
3002	But the median home price rose only 9.75 percent year-over-year in the third quarter of 2022, while in the previous four quarters — Q3-2021 through Q2-2022 — it increased between 14.25 and 16.91 percent. 
3003	That change represented “a considerable deceleration,” according to the report. 
3004	“The only way affordability can improve is if price increases mellow or prices even retreat. There are some sporadic signs of this in the available data so far, but only on a near-term basis — annual references still point to increases, at least so far,” Keith Gumbinger, a vice president at HSH.com, wrote in an email. 
3005	The site reported that the most affordable of the 50 metropolitan areas, based on the lowest income requirements, was Pittsburgh, where the median home price was $210,250, requiring a monthly payment of $1,283 and an annual income of $55,006. 
3006	Oklahoma City and Cleveland were just above it on the list of metropolitan areas requiring the lowest annual income to get a mortgage. 
3007	At the other end of the scale: San Jose, Calif., where the median home price was $1,688,000, requiring a monthly payment of $8,380 and a qualifying annual income of $359,127. 
3008	San Francisco and San Diego took second and third place behind it on the list of cities requiring the highest annual income. 
3009	Because interest rates have fluctuated since the end of the third quarter, today’s salary requirements for homeownership may vary slightly from those noted here.

3014	A recession looks less likely, and fewer Americans are unemployed. 
3015	That was bad news for stocks on Thursday. 
3016	The major indexes fell sharply as fresh economic data revived worries about the Federal Reserve’s attempts to battle inflation. 
3017	“We’re still in a bit of ‘good news is bad news for the market,’ because better-than-expected economic data means the Fed’s going to remain more restrictive on their policies,” said Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at the brokerage firm BTIG. 
3018	The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits increased less than expected last week, Labor Department data showed on Thursday, suggesting that the job market remained tight. 
3019	At the same time, an update on gross domestic product indicated that the economy rebounded faster in the third quarter than previously estimated. 
3020	Combined, the economic reports suggested to investors that the Federal Reserve might need to continue to push interest rates higher and hold them there longer in an attempt to slow the economy. 
3021	In afternoon trading, the S&P 500 was down nearly 3 percent and the tech-heavy Nasdaq index down roughly 3.7 percent. 
3022	By the end of the day, each index had regained some ground. 
3023	The S&P and the Dow fell 1.4 percent and 1 percent, while the Nasdaq finished 2.2 percent lower.S&P 500-%Dow-%Nasdaq-%As of Data delayed at least 15 minutesSource: FactSetStock trading has been volatile throughout the week as investors have grappled with the Fed’s resolve to remain aggressive in its fight against inflation. 
3024	Fed officials indicated last week that interest rates would rise more drastically  than many had expected as policymakers tried to wrangle stubborn price increases.
3025	“We have more work to do,” Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said last week. 
3026	His message echoed around the world as central banks in Europe also announced new rate increases .
3027	Selling intensified on Thursday after David Tepper, the billionaire founder of the hedge fund Appaloosa Management, said on CNBC  that he was betting that stock prices would continue to fall. 
3028	“As a hedge fund manager, I’m going to lean short,” Mr. Tepper said, citing the global movement by central banks to use higher interest rates and other monetary tightening measures to try to slow inflation. 
3029	“I think the upside/downside just doesn’t make sense to me when I have so many people telling me, so many central banks telling me what they’re going to do,” he said. 
3030	The latest update on gross domestic product showed that the U.S. economy grew at an unexpectedly strong 3.2 percent annual pace from July through September. 
3031	That was up from an earlier estimate of 2.9 percent. 
3032	The quarterly growth followed a contraction during the first half of the year. 
3033	Investors will get another update on consumer spending and inflation on Friday, when the government releases the Personal Consumption Expenditures index for November. 
3034	The Fed monitors the report as a barometer of inflation. 
3035	Despite Thursday’s strong numbers, recent economic data have been mixed. 
3036	Experts expect Friday’s report to show that inflation continued to cool in November. 
3037	To Mr. Krinsky, Thursday’s sell-off was not a surprise. 
3038	Stock price movements in December, especially at the end of the month, tend to echo whatever longer-term trend is already in place. 
3039	Fewer market participants are around to trade, and it is unlikely that they will make bold bets at this time of year. 
3040	“We’re still in a bear market,” Mr. Krinsky said, adding that he viewed stock prices as being caught in a lose-lose scenario for the rest of the year. 
3041	“If economic data is better, the Fed’s going to remain restrictive, and if economic data deteriorates we’re probably heading into a much deeper recession. That’s the lose-lose proposition for the market right now,” he said.

3056	An eight-month investigation by The Times has identified the Russian military unit behind one of the worst atrocities  of the war in Ukraine: the killing of dozens of civilians in the Kyiv suburb of Bucha. 
3057	A team of reporters spent months in Bucha after Russian forces withdrew in late March, interviewing residents, collecting security-camera footage and obtaining records from government sources. 
3058	In New York, the reporters analyzed the materials and reconstructed the killings along one street. 
3059	The Times concluded that the perpetrators of a massacre along Yablunska Street were Russian paratroopers from the 234th Air Assault Regiment, based in the city of Pskov in western Russia and led by Lt. Col. Artyom Gorodilov. 
3060	The evidence shows that the killings were intentional. 
3061	Russian troops apparently killed the people as part of a ruthless “clearing” operation to secure a route leading to Kyiv.

3104	When musicians complain about political uses of their songs without permission, the cease-and-desist letters are usually sent to politicians. 
3105	In the case of Journey, it is one band member against another — over a wish for the group to remain apolitical.Last week, a lawyer for Neal Schon, Journey’s founding guitarist, wrote to Jonathan Cain, the group’s keyboardist, demanding that he stop appearing at events for former President Donald J. Trump “as Journey,” and performing Journey songs at those functions, saying that Mr. Cain’s appearances have caused “irreparable harm to the Journey brand.” “Although Mr. Cain is free to express his personal beliefs and associations, when he does that on behalf of Journey or as a representative of the band, such conduct is extremely deleterious to the Journey brand as it polarizes the band’s fans and outreach,” says the letter, a copy of which was provided to The New York Times by representatives of Mr. Schon. 
3106	“Journey is not, and should not be, political,” the letter adds, and notes the risk of a reduced earning potential to its next tour, set to begin in January.The letter points to a performance by Mr. Cain last month of “Don’t Stop Believin’,”  the band’s enduring power ballad, at the America First Experience Gala at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump’s estate in Florida. 
3107	An online video of the event shows Mr. Cain seated at a keyboard, leading a singalong with conservative political figures like Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene, Kimberly Guilfoyle and Kari Lake onstage beside him. 
3108	In the crowd, Mr. Trump is visible along with Newt Gingrich, Donald Trump Jr. and others.Mr. 
3109	Cain has long been connected to Mr. Trump’s inner circle. 
3110	His wife, Paula White, was Mr. Trump’s spiritual adviser during his administration, and she delivered the invocation  at Mr. Trump’s inauguration in 2017.The existence of the letter was first reported by Variety .
3111	In a statement, Mr. Cain said: “Neal Schon should look in the mirror when he accuses me of causing harm to the Journey brand. I have watched him damage our brand for years and am a victim of both his — and his wife’s — bizarre behavior.”He pointed to a number of disputes in the band’s history and what he called Mr. Schon and his wife’s “bullying, toxic, incoherent emails,” and added: “If anyone is destroying the Journey brand, it is Neal — and Neal alone.”Mr. 
3112	Schon’s wife, Michaele, is a onetime reality-TV star who was on “The Real Housewives of D.C.”“Don’t Stop Believin’,” from Journey’s 1981 album “Escape,” was a Top 10 hit when it came out. 
3113	It has also had an enormously successful afterlife, appearing in the final episode of “The Sopranos” in 2007, as well as in the Broadway musical “Rock of Ages.”  Written by Mr. Cain, Mr. Schon and Steve Perry, the group’s former vocalist, the song has racked up more than 1.4 billion streams on Spotify alone. 
3114	Musicians’ complaints about the political use of their songs also usually involves accusations of copyright infringement, but given that Mr. Cain is a co-author, that may be moot, and the letter from Mr. Schon makes no mention of copyright.Instead, its focus is Journey’s desire to remain apolitical. 
3115	The letter links to a radio interview with the band, in which the group was asked whether it would have accepted an invitation to perform at Mr. Trump’s inauguration. 
3116	Mr. Cain answered: “We’re not political. We don’t get into politics. We try to stay in our lane.” 
3117	Mr. Schon added: “The best place to stay is neutral, in the center.” 
3118	Intra-band tensions have long been a part of the story of Journey, which emerged as a progressive rock group in the 1970s — Mr. Schon began his career as a teenager in Santana — and found arena-filling success with dramatic pop-rock in the ’80s.Lately, Mr. Schon and Mr. Cain, who joined the group for “Escape,” have battled over various financial issues , and another letter sent to Mr. Cain this month — by a different lawyer for Mr. Schon, at a different firm — complained that Ms. White was inappropriately interfering in the band’s business affairs.
3119	JERUSALEM — As Israel’s prime minister designate, Benjamin Netanyahu, prepares to swear in his new hard-line government  and return to office, his deals to cement the support of far-right coalition partners are raising widespread concerns about the country’s future as a liberal democracy. 
3120	The emerging coalition will be the most hard-right and religious administration in Israel’s history, made up of Mr. Netanyahu’s conservative Likud party and another five far-right and ultra-Orthodox factions. 
3121	Mr. Netanyahu, Israel’s longest serving prime minister, who was ousted 18 months ago, is on trial for corruption and has grown ever more dependent on these hard-line allies because the more liberal parties refuse to sit in a government led by a premier under criminal indictment. 
3122	That dependency, critics say, has weakened him in the coalition negotiations, forcing him to go along with at least some of the demands for far-reaching changes that would limit the powers of the judiciary and curb the independence of the police. 
3123	Mr. Netanyahu’s hard-line allies need him just as much as he needs them; they, too, have no alternative path to power. 
3124	But their fundamental lack of trust in Mr. Netanyahu, who has a record of breaking promises to coalition partners, led them to insist on a rush of legislation to anchor their new roles and authorities in law, with potentially damaging consequences for the democratic system. 
3125	“What we see in the legislation preceding the formation of the government is a change in the rules of the game of Israeli democracy,” said Gayil Talshir, a political scientist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.The outgoing prime minister, Yair Lapid, a centrist, described the incoming government on Thursday as “dangerous, extremist, irresponsible.”“It will end badly,” he said, calling it “a clearance sale of Israel’s future.” 
3126	The legislative rush and drafts of coalition agreements include proposals that would allow Parliament to override Supreme Court decisions and would give more weight to politicians in the selection of judges. 
3127	Legal amendments would greatly expand the powers of the incoming minister of national security, Itamar Ben-Gvir, who oversees the police. 
3128	Mr. Ben-Gvir is the leader of the ultranationalist Jewish Power party and the main advocate of the bill, which would give him the authority to set policy for the police, something critics say will allow him to politicize the force’s operations. 
3129	He was convicted in the past on charges of inciting racism and of support for a terrorist group, and ran in the election on a bullish ticket of fighting organized crime and increasing governance, particularly in areas heavily populated by members of Israel’s Arab minority. 
3130	Another amendment will allow Bezalel Smotrich, the leader of the Religious Zionism party, to serve as a second minister in the hallowed Ministry of Defense. 
3131	Mr. Smotrich, whose party ultimately seeks to annex the occupied West Bank, has been promised authority over the agencies dealing with Jewish settlements and Palestinian and Israeli civilian life in the occupied West Bank, in consultation with the prime minister.A third change will allow Aryeh Deri, the leader of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, to serve as a minister despite a recent conviction and a suspended prison sentence for tax fraud . 
3132	That amendment, analysts say, could end up applying to Mr. Netanyahu should he ultimately be convicted or reach a plea deal including a suspended sentence.Mr. 
3133	Netanyahu denies all wrongdoing and says the cases against him  will collapse in court. 
3134	Still, experts say, the proposed changes outlined in the coalition agreements are still in flux.
3135	“Constitutional political changes are being carried out in record speed, even before the government has been established,” said Yohanan Plesner, president of the Israel Democracy Institute, a nonpartisan research center. 
3136	“This demonstrates the fragility of our democracy.” 
3137	But Mr. Plesner emphasized that such practices were not unprecedented in Israel and that there were still many possible outcomes.
3138	“There is a discrepancy,” he said, “between the ideas and initiatives and declarations of politicians before elections, and what is actually happening in the negotiating room and being manifested in coalition agreements and government policy.” 
3139	Mr. Netanyahu, who has already pushed Israel further to the right during his 15 years in power, will now be the main force of moderation in his government compared with his more hard-line partners. 
3140	Though he is known for his aggressive campaign tactics, Mr. Netanyahu has generally protected the democratic system during his long tenure. 
3141	He has rejected the warnings about damage to Israeli democracy as fear-mongering by those who lost the election and has pledged to act in the interest of all Israel’s citizens.
3142	“We were elected to lead in our way, the way of the national right and the way of the liberal right,” he said in a recent speech to Parliament, “and that’s what we will do.” 
3143	The most immediate concerns revolve around the law expanding the powers of Mr. Ben-Gvir, the national security minister. 
3144	It has passed its first reading in Parliament but is still pending final approval. 
3145	In the past, the minister overseeing the police would set policy priorities in consultation with the commissioner of police, but would not interfere in operational matters or have any influence over investigations. 
3146	The proposed legislation subordinates the police to the minister’s authority, leading legal officials and experts to fear a politicization of the force. 
3147	And it grants the minister the right to set priorities and time frames for investigations in a departure from past practices. 
3148	“The Israel Police will be run under a threatening and belligerent man who lacks responsibility and experience, who wishes to turn it into a political agency,” and to turn the police commissioner into a “puppet,” the outgoing minister of public security, Omer Bar-Lev, told Parliament this week. 
3149	Mr. Ben-Gvir argues that the police should be subordinate to a minister’s policy in the same way that the military carries out the government’s policy. 
3150	But critics say that unlike the military, which fights Israel’s enemies, the mission of the police is to deal with Israeli citizens — including corrupt politicians.Aida Touma-Sliman, a Palestinian-Israeli lawmaker, told the committee discussing the bill that the incoming minister’s goals were “ideological” and “racist” and would end up creating a “political police.” 
3151	Human rights activists say they are worried that the legislation giving Mr. Ben-Gvir broader control over the police could be used to suppress protests. 
3152	Noa Sattath, the executive director of the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, said her organization petitioned the parliamentary committee discussing the bill to exclude protests from Mr. Ben-Gvir’s areas of authority, as did the committee’s own legal adviser. 
3153	But Mr. Ben-Gvir rejected that recommendation. 
3154	“Clearly the minister wants to have authority over the way the police deal with protests,” said Ms. Sattath, who described the bill as endangering one of the foundations of the Israeli democratic system. 
3155	In the face of mounting criticism, Mr. Ben-Gvir told the parliamentary committee on Thursday that he would postpone the discussions and voting on the most contentious parts of the bill until after the inauguration of the government. 
3156	Also of concern are the proposals to change the way the judiciary operates. 
3157	If implemented, they will dramatically curb the powers of the Supreme Court, which has long been seen by liberal Israelis and analysts as one of the country’s most important institutions safeguarding against the erosion of liberal democratic values. 
3158	Because Israel has only one house of Parliament and no formal constitution, the judiciary plays a critical role in protecting minority rights and offsetting rule by the parliamentary majority. 
3159	The coalition partners are keen to see these judicial changes, not least to ensure that the Supreme Court cannot overturn the hasty legislation now making its way through Parliament. 
3160	“In the coming weeks we will have to face the most significant threats Israeli democracy has seen in recent decades,” Mr. Plesner said at a recent conference at his institute on the implications of the judicial changes proposed by members of the incoming coalition.
3161	“The issues on the agenda concern the nature of the state and the basic rights of each and every one of us.”Myra Noveck  contributed reporting from Jerusalem.
3162	Last year, Madison Winey, 29, wanted to use her vacation days to drive from San Francisco, where she lives, to Bend, Ore., to visit her family. 
3163	But taking time off from her job as a lawyer at Goodwin Procter always felt like “more stress than it’s worth, especially if you’re just going away for a couple of days,” she said. 
3164	She would have to start planning for her absence weeks before leaving, and she was expected to provide times when she would check emails. 
3165	She had scheduled the visit when she thought there would be a bit of a lull at work — but a project timeline was delayed by two weeks, forcing her to postpone her trip. 
3166	“All I needed was nine hours on a Saturday to be able to drive up to Bend, and I wasn’t even able to take that,” she said. 
3167	When she finally made it to Oregon, she worked the whole time. 
3168	Despite decades of research that has found that taking time off is good for workers’ mental and physical health, Ms. Winey’s experience is not unique. 
3169	For those who are fortunate enough to receive paid time off at work, the majority of whom are full-time office workers, using those precious days can also create anxiety about re-entry. 
3170	In a survey in November, the career website Monster found that 87 percent of over 1,000 American workers across industries experienced post-vacation stress and anxiety, which the company named “P.T.O. woes ,” and that 72 percent of workers refrained from taking vacation at all to avoid that stress. 
3171	Psychologists and therapists classify post-vacation angst as anticipatory anxiety, a generic term to describe fear and worry about bad things that might happen in the future.Dr. 
3172	Rebecca Brendal, president of the American Psychiatric Association, likened the experience to the Sunday scaries, a term that has become popular on social media to refer to the dread one feels at the end of the weekend about going back to work. 
3173	It is a cause for concern during this holiday season because it dovetails with a sharp increase in burnout among workers  in recent months, she said. 
3174	“We know that mental health concerns are up and anxiety is up. The stress that Americans are facing every day has gotten to the point that taking time off has become stressful,” Dr. Brendal said.In one widely cited study, published in 2000, researchers found that vacationing every year reduced overall risk of death. 
3175	Brooks Gump, a professor of public health at Syracuse University and a co-author of that paper, ran a similar study last year. 
3176	He and his team found  that while workers with low-stress jobs felt calmer and less anxious before, during and after a vacation, those feelings didn’t seem to extend to those in high-stress jobs. 
3177	“Certain positions allow you to ease out and back into work, but high-stress jobs don’t really provide that context for a true break,” Dr. Gump said. 
3178	Morra Aarons-Mele, author of “The Anxious Achiever,” said she hears about this phenomenon often as a consultant for corporate teams. 
3179	“So few work cultures actually encourage people to unplug, and most view working all the time as a badge of honor,” she said. 
3180	Eventually, Ms. Winey left the law firm for a role that was less client-focused and more flexible — but not everyone can just quit. 
3181	And a large part of workers’ ability to take time off at all, much less enjoy it, is dependent on their industry or company culture. 
3182	Still, if you are able to get that vacation time, there are small steps you can take to minimize stress and reap its many benefits.More than half of the respondents to Monster’s survey reported having to work overtime in order to catch up when they returned from paid time off. 
3183	One way to help minimize the stress on your first day back is to carve out time for it before you leave, creating an “offramp” for yourself, said Simone Stolzoff, author of the forthcoming book “The Good Enough Job.” “Offramping is basically time you spend, while you’re still on the clock, to prepare for what you might do when you’re back on the clock,” he said. 
3184	You can make a list of priorities to tackle when you’re back, find co-workers who are willing to handle time-sensitive tasks while you’re out or set up time to catch up with them when you’re back.Prepare everyone around you before you leave, Dr. Brendal said. 
3185	“Effective managers and leaders who I try to emulate will start putting their out of office message up a week before they actually go out,” she noted. 
3186	“When I first saw that, I would think, ‘Why are they signaling their vacation a week in advance?’ And then I realized it’s to set reasonable expectations.” 
3187	Whether you set your out-of-office message before your trip or at the outset, Dr. Brendal said, be clear about whom can be contacted in your absence in the case of a real crisis. 
3188	Also, include a realistic time by which you will respond, which might be a few days after you return and dig yourself out of the email pile. 
3189	If your workplace uses additional communication platforms, like Slack or Microsoft Teams, set detailed away messages on those as well. 
3190	You may even want to delete work apps from your phone or, at least, turn their notifications off. 
3191	Making it clear in your away messages that you will be completely detached enables you to truly unplug. 
3192	Khemaridh Hy, a 43-year-old entrepreneur, still remembers coming back from his honeymoon 10 years ago to a mountain of email from his job at the financial firm BlackRock. 
3193	Any lingering relaxation was wiped out. 
3194	“I swear, I probably sprouted my first gray hairs on that flight back, because there were like 1,700 unread messages,” he said. 
3195	“It’s almost like you’re damned if you do and you’re damned if you don’t: If you do check your email and stay on top of things, then your spouse is like, ‘You’re always thinking about work.’ But if you don’t, you know that the minute you turn this thing back on, your life’s going to suck,” he said. 
3196	Though his honeymoon was 10 years ago, it still stands out in his memory as a vacation that, though enjoyable, also caused him a lot of anxiety — a feeling that has continued almost every time he has taken a vacation since then. 
3197	Now, Mr. Hy uses email filters to keep his inbox from becoming overwhelming. 
3198	“I always filter out a message where I’m not in the “To” line. 
3199	It doesn’t mean I don’t read it, but I won’t prioritize reading it,” he said. 
3200	As counterintuitive as it sounds, if the emails at the other end of a vacation are keeping you up at night, you can schedule pockets of time during your vacation to just clean out the inbox, said Ms. Aarons-Mele, who almost always spends some time during vacations staying on top of messages. 
3201	She’ll also share that plan with her husband so that they can hold each other accountable. 
3202	“He’ll be like, ‘I have a call at 2 p.m. but I’m not going to be online other than that.’ And I’ll say, ‘I am checking email today, but tomorrow I won’t,’” she said. 
3203	Those specific, limited goals, she said, can keep work from taking over an entire day.Alternatively, you can recruit a work buddy to text you an update every now and then, reassuring you that things are going smoothly, said Laura Vanderkam, author of “Tranquility by Tuesday: 9 Ways to Calm the Chaos and Make Time for What Matters.” 
3204	She said it was “kind of the equivalent of reading through 300 emails but much more efficient.” 
3205	You may need to make a plan for what you will do with your free time so that you are not tempted to check in or think about work.Many American workers have “internalized this belief that if we aren’t getting ahead, then we’re somehow falling behind,” Mr. Stolzoff said. 
3206	“Our idea of self-worth and identity has just become so wrapped up in productivity that when we’re not being productive, we believe we are somehow less than.” 
3207	As a result, “people get caught in a sort of chicken-and-egg problem where they work all the time so they don’t know what to do when they aren’t working, and because they don’t know what to do when they aren’t working, they end up working all the time,” he said.This is often a problem for Ms. Aarons-Mele when she takes time off. 
3208	“I’m the worst — I’ll wake up at a beach resort and be like, ‘Now what?’” 
3209	To avoid falling into that trap, she said, you can schedule activities during your vacation that require focus: Sign up for a class, volunteer with an organization or visit a museum, whatever feels fulfilling and distracts you from your screens. 
3210	If you’re able to space out your return home and your back-to-office day, put something on your calendar that you can look forward to for that time in between, Ms. Vanderkam said.
3211	“Let’s say you’re taking a trip and you come back the day before you start work. Maybe plan a get-together with friends that afternoon or go see a movie that night,” she said. 
3212	“It’ll ensure you are not fixated on the thought of starting work the next day. You’ll likely be thinking about the fun still to come as opposed to the anxiety of starting work.”A lot of times, the scenes that you envision about all the things that could go haywire at work while you’re away or the daunting situations you have to come back to are just your brain inventing catastrophes, said Bisma Anwar, a licensed therapist on the telehealth platform Talkspace: “We tend to build up things in our minds, and it’s usually not as bad as we think.”To pull yourself out of that mind-set, Ms. Anwar suggested, ground yourself in the moment by meditating or working out so that bad thoughts don’t ruin your time off. 
3213	While doing so, you can look back on all you achieved before vacation, Ms. Aarons-Mele said, “and tell yourself, I worked hard, I did a lot, I accomplished a lot, I deserve a break.” 
3214	And if you’re away for an extended period, remind yourself that most issues that come up at work in the first few days will probably be irrelevant by the time you return, Ms. Vanderkam said, so there isn’t much point worrying about them from a distance. 
3215	If something is important enough for your attention, it will come up again when you’re back at work and ready to address it.
3216	At first glance, you might miss the glass frog of the Costa Rican rainforest. 
3217	It is, as the name suggests, nearly transparent. 
3218	Apart from a lime green smear across its back, its skin, muscle and other tissues are see-through. 
3219	Then there are its tiny organs, which seem to float within this clear flesh, like a pale fruit cocktail in the weirdest Jell-O salad ever to grace a tree branch. 
3220	As handy as translucence might be for evading predators, it is rare in animals that live on land. 
3221	Their bodies are full of substances that light can’t penetrate, many of them essential for life. 
3222	Glass frogs seem to have evolved see-through versions of some of these anatomical features, but they also have some tricks to hide lingering colors when they are at their most vulnerable.In a study published in the journal Science on Thursday , researchers report that when a glass frog falls asleep, almost all of its red blood cells retreat into its liver. 
3223	They hide in the organ and allow the frog to achieve near invisibility while it rests. 
3224	In addition to revealing another remarkable adaptation in nature, the discovery could lead to clues for how to prevent deadly blood clots. 
3225	Like people, glass frogs rely on hemoglobin, a colored protein in red blood cells that delivers oxygen around the body. 
3226	Jesse Delia and Carlos Taboada, biologists and authors of the new paper, had been spending a lot of time observing the frogs when they realized that sometimes, that red color seemed to disappear.
3227	“When they are awake, the circulatory system is red,” Dr. Delia, who works at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, said. 
3228	“When they are asleep, it’s not.”Where were the red cells going? 
3229	To solve the mystery of the disappearing blood cells, the researchers and their colleagues wanted to take images of the frogs under anesthesia — when the blood cells were clearly visible circulating through their bodies — and asleep, when the cells were nowhere to be seen. 
3230	To do that, they needed to find a way to peer inside the frog’s organs, which have a mirror-like exterior that helps the frog blend in. 
3231	Dr. Taboada, a researcher at Duke University, said they suspected the blood would retreat to various organs when not in circulation. 
3232	The researchers wound up relying not on light but on sound to show them what was inside. 
3233	They provoked the molecules within the sacs to release ultrasonic waves, which could be used to identify the contents. 
3234	As soon as they compared the images of sleeping and anesthetized frogs, one big difference jumped out. 
3235	“All the signal was coming from the liver,” Dr. Taboada said. 
3236	About 89 percent of the frogs’ red blood cells had packed themselves into that organ. 
3237	That made sense: The liver, which filters blood, is a logical destination for red blood cells, he said.What was stranger, and what the researchers still don’t understand, was how the frogs could cram all these cells together without dying from blood clots. 
3238	In most vertebrates, when blood cells bump into each other, it leads to coagulation. 
3239	The resulting clot can make a scab to seal a wound — or, if the clot is in a blood vessel, it can plug up the circulatory system and kill the creature. 
3240	In the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , as many as 100,000 people die from blood clots each year. 
3241	Glass frogs, the new research suggests, can control when their blood clots. 
3242	If they are wounded, they will form a scab in the usual way. 
3243	But when they are asleep, with red blood cells packed like sardines in the liver, no clot forms. 
3244	The finding implies that glass frogs could have something to teach us about how to prevent clot formation in our own bodies. 
3245	If future research can illuminate what keeps the frogs safe, it could lead to treatments to reduce deaths from clots in humans. 
3246	More immediately, the researchers said, the results raised other questions. 
3247	If 89 percent of the cells that carry oxygen are holed up in the liver while the frog sleeps, how is it breathing? 
3248	They wonder whether the frogs can shift their metabolisms to a mode that requires barely any oxygen, perhaps akin to what other frogs do when they hibernate for the winter. 
3249	The new paper is just the beginning of this line of research. 
3250	The team has already improved their imaging techniques to scan the frogs more quickly and to reveal substances other than blood as they move around in the creatures.
3251	“We’re in the lab now,” Dr. Delia said during a phone interview. 
3252	“There’s literally a frog scanning right now in the system. I have to go check on it in a bit.”
3253	Why make a movie? 
3254	Why watch one? 
3255	As banal as these questions are, they’re also unsettling. 
3256	The world is so flooded with images that making sense of what’s already there can feel paralyzing; adding something new can seem like the very definition of absurdity. 
3257	Sentimentality about the power of cinema — to raise awareness, expand empathy, confront the truth, change the world — mirrors a cynicism that insists on cinema’s triviality. 
3258	It’s only a movie! 
3259	That’s as true of “No Bears” as of anything else, but there may be no living filmmaker who has considered the practical and philosophical implications of the art form — the work of shooting and cutting; the pleasure and anxiety of watching — as rigorously or as insightfully as the Iranian director Jafar Panahi.He can’t be accused of taking movies lightly, or of taking himself too seriously. 
3260	He has continued to practice his craft, conscientiously and playfully, at the risk of his comfort, his freedom and possibly his life. 
3261	When in 2010 the Iranian government banned him from directing, he answered with “This Is Not a Film ,” a feature-length video diary shot partly on an iPhone and technically not “directed” at all.In the years since, he has continued in that vein of clandestine metacinema, playing himself (in “Closed Curtain” and “Taxi ”) less as a heroic auteur than as a curious, gentle, sometimes foolish middle-aged family man who can’t break the habit of turning life into film (or, to be precise, digital video). 
3262	His movies are personal and also political, as he aims his quizzical gaze at the petty hypocrisies and large injustices of modern Iran, as well as at the paradoxes of his own creative practice.Not long after “No Bears” was completed — it was filmed in secret earlier this year — Panahi was sentenced in Iran to six years in prison. 
3263	In the months since, mass protests challenging the authority of the Islamic Republic have swept across the country and have been answered with brutal repression .
3264	The movie doesn’t explicitly address the unrest or any other public matters; Iranian filmmakers tend to deal with potentially controversial issues obliquely, walking the line between realism and fable and trusting audiences to understand the implications of their stories, subtle messages that censors might overlook. 
3265	Panahi pioneered this approach in the early 2000s — while also testing its limits — confronting misogyny and class inequality in films like “The Circle,” “Crimson Gold” and “Offside .” 
3266	Since the ban, as his work has reflected his own predicament, he has found new ways to combine social criticism with self-criticism. 
3267	“No Bears” finds Panahi (again playing himself) occupying rented rooms in a village near the Turkish border, far from his home in Tehran. 
3268	In a small city in Turkey not far from the village, a film is being shot under his direction — one apparently based on the real-life story of two Iranian exiles, Zara (Mina Kavani) and Bakhtiar (Bakhtiar Panjei), who hope to find asylum in France. 
3269	Panahi supervises the production on his laptop and his cellphone when he has a signal, which isn’t often. 
3270	His assistant director, Reza (Reza Heydari), tries to convince Panahi to visit the set, perhaps with the help of the smugglers and human traffickers who control the area. 
3271	But the border is a line the director won’t cross. 
3272	Back in the village, he finds himself mixed up in a complicated feud involving a young couple (Amir Davari and Darya Alei) and a bitter romantic rival (Javad Siyahi). 
3273	It is the belief of interested parties on both sides that a picture Panahi may or may not have taken will have some bearing on the case. 
3274	The village chief (Naser Hashemi) gets involved, as does Panahi’s host, an unctuous fellow named Ghanbar (Vahid Mobaseri). 
3275	Compared with the tense drama surrounding Zara and Bakhtiar, what happens to the filmmaker seems at first like comic relief — a fish-out-of-water caper about a big-city sophisticate snagged by rustic brambles. 
3276	Everyone in the village is unstintingly, ostentatiously polite. 
3277	Ghanbar never fails to address Panahi as “dear sir,” and Panahi responds with fulsome gratitude, but mutual resentment simmers beneath their interactions, and the rituals of courtesy and deference that govern Panahi’s dealings with Ghanbar’s neighbors are heavy with mistrust, hostility and even the possibility of violence. 
3278	I won’t give anything away, except to say that when tragedy arrives — in and behind the scenes of Zara and Bakhtiar’s story, and in every fold of the film’s constructed reality — it feels both shocking and grimly inevitable. 
3279	It also seems to be, partially and inadvertently but also unmistakably, the filmmaker’s fault. 
3280	At one point, Panahi is summoned to the village “swear room,” where he is expected to testify about his suspicious photograph. 
3281	It isn’t a legal proceeding — a sympathetic elder tells him it’s permissible to lie — but rather one of many local traditions established to keep up appearances and rein in unruly behavior. 
3282	Before making his statement, Panahi asks that the Quran be replaced by a video camera, which he believes will endow his words with unimpeachable credibility. 
3283	But what if this show of faith — in visual evidence, in the documentary record, in the moral prestige of the moving image — is itself a kind of superstition? 
3284	That’s the uncomfortable question that “No Bears” faces, one that challenges not only its own assumptions but also the piety of an audience eager to embrace the film as a gesture of resistance and to bless itself for recognizing the gesture. 
3285	Panahi, whose courage and honesty are beyond doubt, has made a movie that calls those very qualities into question, a movie about its own ethical limits and aesthetic contradictions. 
3286	Maybe art can’t save anyone, or change anything. 
3287	So why bother with it? 
3288	I’m tempted to say that “No Bears” answers that question simply by existing, but to do so would be to understate Panahi’s accomplishment.The title refers to an encounter he has on the way to the swear room, a meeting with a stranger that seems like something out of a folk tale. 
3289	The man cautions that there are dangerous bears lurking in the darkness, and later dismisses his own warning. 
3290	“Our fear empowers others,” he says. 
3291	“No Bears!” 
3292	That’s a good slogan, and a necessary belief in a very scary world, but also, maybe, a consoling fiction. 
3293	To insist that there are no bears may just be a polite way of acknowledging that the bears are us.No Bears Not rated. 
3294	Running time: 1 hour 46 minutes. 
3295	In theaters.
3296	The best that can be said about Damien Chazelle’s “Babylon” is that there are still big Hollywood studios like Paramount around to spend wads of cash on self-flattering indulgences. 
3297	It’s perversely comforting. 
3298	Despite all the real and imagined existential hurdles that the movie business is facing, its agonies over the future of theatrical exhibition and of streaming, the industry holds fast to the belief that audiences will turn out to watch an ode to its favorite subject: itself. 
3299	So kudos to Paramount, which also released this year’s box-office titleholder “Top Gun: Maverick” — at the very least, “Babylon” is further proof of life.It’s also a bloated folly, which is in keeping with an industry that has a habit of supersizing itself  in times of crisis. 
3300	To tell his tale, Chazelle has turned back the clock to the years right before the business adapted synchronous sound as the industry standard. 
3301	In basic outline, he frames this period largely as one of unbridled personal freedom, a time in which film folk partied hard, guzzling rivers of booze while snorting Sahara-sized dunes of drugs and joylessly writhing to jazzy squalling. 
3302	The next morning, the freewheeling revelers then stumbled into the blazing California sun for another day of filmmaking. 
3303	Written by Chazelle, “Babylon” centers on three industry types — a powerful star, a soon-to-be minted starlet and an up-and-coming executive — whose lives first intersect in a frenzied blowout crowded with attendees thrashing wildly, their mouths, arms, legs, breasts and assorted other bits flapping in a simulacrum of ecstasy. 
3304	The star is Jack Conrad (Brad Pitt in usual smooth form), an M.G.M. headliner with a dashing mustache, a string of hits and a romantic life that, despite his boozing, is as robust as his health. 
3305	The movie’s humor — and Chazelle’s amused approach — is signaled when Jack tells a flirty waitress to bring him multiple drinks. 
3306	He slurps buckets, and then gets it energetically on with the server. 
3307	Like the powder nasally vacuumed by another partyer, a grasping would-be star, Nellie LaRoy (a badly used Margot Robbie), Jack’s drinking is, for Chazelle, an emblem of the unfettered spirit of the age before the fun was spoiled by, well, it’s unclear by whom, since the only serious villain is a gangster played by a persuasively repellent Tobey Maguire. 
3308	(Wall Street, which has done far more damage to the movies than any entity, is conspicuously M.I.A.) 
3309	Jack’s and Nellie’s abilities to perform no matter what, on camera and off, are among their most defining traits, near-super powers as well as a steady source of strained comedy. 
3310	Much of the first two hours restively bounces from Jack to Nellie and Manny Torres (Diego Calva), a doe-eyed Mexican naïf whom Jack hires as an assistant. 
3311	A fast, smart problem solver and a total mensch, Manny soon assumes greater responsibility and becomes a studio executive, a straighter trajectory than either Jack or Nellie’s hairpin roads. 
3312	Manny is an outlier, an immigrant of color in a predominantly white business, but he’s a survivor, too, open to change and highly adaptable. 
3313	Like Calva, Manny is appealing, even if the character is preposterously nice for a clichéd Hollywood striver. 
3314	But it’s never really clear what makes him run and mostly he functions as a proxy for the audience, a gaga witness to the looniness. 
3315	Compared to the larger-than-life, at times cartoonish, more physically demonstrative performances delivered by Pitt and especially Robbie, Calva is relatively tamped down and reactive, which brings his turn closer to contemporary notions of realism. 
3316	These differences add complexity and much-needed rhythm changes. 
3317	Similarly to his characters, Chazelle has embraced excess as a guiding principle in “Babylon, and like his film “La La Land,” this one shifts between intimate interludes and elaborate set pieces, one difference being that Chazelle now has a heftier budget and is eager to show off his new toys. 
3318	At the inaugural bacchanal, the camera doesn’t soar; it darts and swoops like a coked-up hummingbird. 
3319	Despite the relentless churn on set and after hours, the movie is strangely juiceless. 
3320	I don’t simply mean that it’s unsexy (which it is), but that there’s so little life in the movie, despite all the frantic action. 
3321	There isn’t much going on other than the spectacle of its busily spinning parts, which might be tolerable if the first two hours weren’t so unrelievedly unmodulated, with everything synced to the same monotonous, accelerated pace. 
3322	This hyperventilated quality initially serves the story and Chazelle’s concept of the era’s delirious excess, but the lack of modulation rapidly becomes enervating. 
3323	After a while, it feels punishing. 
3324	There’s something juvenile and paradoxically puritanical about Chazelle’s focus on the characters’ drinking and drugging and hard-living, and not just because their exertions don’t seem very fun. 
3325	They work and party, hit marks and cut loose, follow directions and run wild; you see their technique, stamina, flubs, upstaging tricks and power moves, as well as their bloodshot eyes. 
3326	Jack, Nellie and Manny seem to like making films, or at least they like the perks, and each speaks of the magic (or whatever) of movies. 
3327	But their offscreen habits aren’t interesting — people do drugs and have sex, big whoop — and the real scandal is that there’s nothing special about their films, which Chazelle makes look silly, slapdash and ugly.The shift to sync sound was cataclysmic for the industry and fascinating, though in ways that aren’t evident here, partly because Chazelle isn’t terribly invested in historical accuracy. 
3328	Instead, with “Babylon” he has whipped up a Hollywood counter history that focuses on the era’s putative excesses and rebuts (and luxuriates in) the industry’s carefully sanitized, high-minded profile. 
3329	This kind of revisionist take isn’t new; the movies love revisiting and lampooning themselves. 
3330	Ryan Murphy took a different tack in his Netflix series “Hollywood,”  which wishfully rewrites the past so that everyone who the industry marginalized or excluded — men and women of color, gay and straight — gets to triumph.Chazelle doesn’t bother with positive role models or social uplift. 
3331	Mostly, he is entranced by what Hollywood tried to keep hidden, particularly in the wake of some highly publicized scandals in the 1920s. 
3332	To deflect attention from the federal government and the censorship threat it posed, the industry began polishing its image and strictly enforcing its self-drafted Production Code  (no extramarital sex, etc.). 
3333	In public, the studios and their fixers promoted stars as ideals while quietly facilitating abortions, hiding affairs and keeping performers deep in the closet — all fodder for the veiled innuendo of gossip columnists and tabloid magazines.There are moments in “Babylon,” say, in one of its set pieces or in Nellie’s skillfully forced tears, when you see what it might have been if Chazelle had paid as much attention to the era’s films, their pleasure and beauty, as to its lurid stories. 
3334	He’s crammed a lot in, including Irving Thalberg (Max Minghella), the legendary M.G.M. producer who butchered Erich von Stroheim’s 1924 masterpiece “Greed .” 
3335	A clownish Stroheim-esque type (an uncredited Spike Jonze) also pops up in “Babylon,” and both he and the epic he’s directing are played for laughs. 
3336	Here, as throughout this disappointing movie, what’s missing is the one thing that defined the silent era at its greatest and to which Chazelle remains bafflingly oblivious: its art.Babylon Rated R for drugs, drinking, nudity and lots of elephant dung. 
3337	Running time: 3 hours 8 minutes. 
3338	In theaters.
3339	The princess industrial complex is usually associated with Disney and its procession of royal girls and women from Snow White to Ariel and Tiana. 
3340	The category also works nicely for all of the many other ostensibly grown-up entertainments about girls and women with heavy crowns. 
3341	Few ever seem happy with their station in life, and while some find a prince and secure a happily ever after, others break and still others mount improbable great escapes. 
3342	“Corsage” is the Austrian writer-director Marie Kreutzer’s bold, visually striking and ingeniously anachronistic portrait of an empress in complicated rebellion. 
3343	The rebel — a mesmerizing Vicky Krieps — is the Empress of Austria and Queen of Hungary, Elisabeth Amalie Eugenie (1837-1898). 
3344	Married at 16 to Franz Joseph, the ruler of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Elisabeth now has two children, a retinue of servants and no obvious cares. 
3345	A celebrated beauty, she wears tight corsets and glorious frocks, adhering to a regimen of regular exercise and a diet that often consists of little more than beef broth and the slenderest of orange slices. 
3346	Elisabeth is whisper thin, but something other than vanity and social mores is eating away at her — boredom, despair, a sense of purposelessness — sending uneasy ripples through her life. 
3347	“She scares me so much,” a maid timidly whispers of Elisabeth, who’s first seen submerged in the royal tub, the camera pointing down at her. 
3348	Her eyes are open, and she’s holding her nose, timing her breath ostensibly for health reasons. 
3349	It’s both a useful exercise and a suitable metaphor for “Corsage” (the word also means the bodice of a woman’s dress), especially given Elisabeth’s penchant for tightlacing her corset, which tests her very breath. 
3350	“Corsage” takes place over a number of months starting in late 1877, the year Elisabeth turns 40. 
3351	Hers is a predictably cosseted, sumptuous life. 
3352	(The locations include the Hapsburg Palace in Vienna, the former principal residence for the titular dynasty.) 
3353	Kreutzer — this is her fifth feature film — charts the coordinates of Elisabeth’s quotidian reality from the get-go, briskly presenting its luxuries but also, importantly, letting you see how at ease Elisabeth is in this rarefied world. 
3354	It’s clear that she lacks for nothing, at least materially. 
3355	From the way that she holds her head, directs her gaze and impatiently speaks to her maids and ladies in waiting, it’s also evident that she isn’t chafing against her entitlements.With wit, a cool eye and fluid precision, Kreutzer tracks Elisabeth across the next eventful months. 
3356	Turning 40 proves a difficult milestone for the queen and disrupts her life, though not always for the worse. 
3357	She’s already a subject of gossip inside and outside the palace, and her weight, habits and appearances can set tongues wagging. 
3358	The pressure of getting older only makes matters worse. 
3359	At 40, Elisabeth says in voice-over, soon after blowing out her birthday candles, “a person begins to disperse and fade.” 
3360	Her distress is palpable, and it’s no wonder, given the creepy, slightly comic, near-threatening song that Franz Joseph (Florian Teichtmeister) and others sing to her on her birthday: “Beautiful may she remain.” 
3361	There’s a knot of complication in the word “remain,” which suggests that Elisabeth is never permitted to change. 
3362	That’s underscored by her regimented life — with its rituals of deference, its protocols, its quiet and violent power — which is structured to uphold the institution of the monarchy and the divine right of kings, even as the modern world shudders outside. 
3363	Part of the story’s tension stems from Elisabeth’s role in the empire’s dual monarchy, which makes her leader of two countries she has no real say over. 
3364	Her realm is the rooms she occupies; her subjects, her staff. 
3365	She oversees her children, but Franz Joseph is the king. 
3366	Elisabeth’s rebellion isn’t overt and obvious; it comes in stages, in small and large gestures, in furtive cigarettes, reckless flirtations and wild gallops across far-off fields. 
3367	Krieps is wonderful to watch in motion, whether she’s in the saddle, crossing swords or just leaving a dinner. 
3368	But she’s a virtuoso of stillness, and at times she brings to mind old Hollywood sphinxes like Garbo and Dietrich, whose inscrutable faces worked like wonderful screens on which you could project whatever fantasies you wanted. 
3369	Yet Krieps is also a performer of the present moment, gesturally and otherwise, which is ideal for a character who’s caught between the old world and the new, and between the privileges that at once exalt and suffocate her. 
3370	“Corsage” opens and closes with Elisabeth facing watery voids, ambiguous visions that speak to her desire for change, perhaps transcendence. 
3371	Visions of escape run through stories about unhappily pampered women. 
3372	Rarely, though, do the gilded agonies, especially of princesses and queens, offer real surprises, partly because anything too alien would break the profitable (binge-worthy) illusion of the relatable royal. 
3373	Kreutzer retains a critical distance from Elisabeth; she’s sympathetic and skeptical of the character, and shrewdly doesn’t try to fashion her into a martyr or feminist role model. 
3374	Making Elisabeth interestingly human proves more than enough, a feat that Kreutzer and Krieps accomplish to dazzling effect.Corsage Not rated. 
3375	Running time: 1 hour 53 minutes.

3377	When you picture Ron DeSantis, is he smiling or glowering? 
3378	Telling you about some new project he’ll bring to life or some group of people he’ll bring to their knees? 
3379	Sowing inspiration or vowing retribution? 
3380	I’m guessing he’s the seething protagonist of a revenge thriller. 
3381	That’s precisely the starring role he wants.Here’s DeSantis as he tortures Disney for daring to disagree with his pet education law — he’s a Republican contract killer coming for Mickey Mouse. 
3382	Here he is punishing and publicly shaming a Tampa-area prosecutor who doesn’t share his restrictive views on abortion. 
3383	And here he is insisting that a grand jury in Florida investigate Pfizer and Moderna  for allegedly exaggerating the efficacy of Covid vaccines.His big set piece is a sadistic game with migrants , whom he relocates from Texas to Martha’s Vineyard not to benefit them but to bedevil his Democratic adversaries. 
3384	And his vow to make Florida “where woke goes to die”? 
3385	Woke isn’t meeting any natural end in the Sunshine State. 
3386	It’s crossing paths with an assassin. 
3387	The Florida governor and Republican supernova models a version of politics not as messy theater for problem solving but as spiteful arena for retaliation, in which you’re defined by your enemies — or, rather, by how effectively you torment them.An arena like the House of Representatives in the new year, when Republicans assume control of the chamber. 
3388	How soon will they come for Hunter Biden? 
3389	Anthony Fauci? 
3390	Alejandro Mayorkas? 
3391	They’re itching to impeach anyone who sits still long enough to be impeached. 
3392	They’re bent on humiliation . 
3393	That approach isn’t new, nor is it confined to one party. 
3394	It’s what has turned Supreme Court confirmation hearings into such splenetic spectacles, with senators scoring the most points by exhibiting the most disdain for nominees and making them squirm most visibly.But Donald Trump raised it several nasty notches during and after his 2016 presidential campaign, when he beamed as his Hillary-hating supporters chanted, “Lock her up!” 
3395	He understood that in an era of such intense negative partisanship, with so many people voting against  the other team, grudges were gold.
3396	“He enjoyed some of his success by being viciously retaliatory,”  James Kimmel Jr. 
3397	, a lecturer in psychiatry at the Yale University School of Medicine, said when we spoke recently. 
3398	“That has worked for him, at least in outward-seeming ways.” 
3399	It carried him to “the highest pulpit that the country has available,” Kimmel noted, and other people — including other politicians — extract lessons from that.DeSantis did. 
3400	That’s obvious in his public remarks, like the ones he made in Pennsylvania on behalf of Doug Mastriano, the Republican nominee for governor of the state, before the midterms. 
3401	Gabriel Sherman described the scene in a profile of DeSantis in Vanity Fair: He offered cursory praise for Mastriano and then uncorked a grievance-fueled stump speech that sounded like it had been written by A.I. plugged into Fox News. 
3402	In DeSantis’s telling, the honest people of Florida were besieged by a vast array of liberal scourges: Big Tech, I.R.S. agents, George Soros, the Biden administration, the corporate media, illegal immigrants, Anthony Fauci, police defunders, Disney, China, communism, cancel culture, critical race theory, and woke gender ideology. 
3403	Only Ron DeSantis was brave enough to confront these malign forces.The cynicism and nihilism stoked by rants like that get the country nowhere, and the supremacy of revenge as a political tactic allows politicians who are receiving legitimate scrutiny — as Trump is for his tax returns  — to explain it away as reflexive payback. 
3404	If everyone’s perceived as indiscriminately vengeful, no investigation has merit and no investigator is on the side of the angels. 
3405	That suits DeSantis. 
3406	He’s a self-styled terminator and, silly me, I thought real leaders were supposed to be germinators. 
3407	But that’s not the temper of these times. 
3408	DeSantis has sized them up accurately. 
3409	And shrunk himself accordingly.There has been significant attention lately to strife at The Washington Post , whose publisher stunned the staff with an abrupt announcement of imminent layoffs. 
3410	So what better time to celebrate the fine journalists and journalism there? 
3411	I’ll start with a distinguished group of them.Dana Milbank has been listening closely to Representative Kevin McCarthy as the California Republican campaigns, ineloquently, to become the next speaker of the House: “Deep in his brain there seems to be a syntax scrambler (I’m guessing it was put there by Hunter Biden, or perhaps the Chinese) that causes violent clashes between subjects and objects, nouns and verbs, singular and plural, and past and present.” (Thanks to Donna Silver of Madison, Wis., and Arlyne Willcox of Manhasset, N.Y., for nominating this.)David Von Drehle connected Sam Bankman-Fried to Elizabeth Holmes and others of their ilk: “Tumbling down the well-worn staircase from brilliant to colorful to embattled to disgraced, Bankman-Fried landed in a pile of battered demigods.” (Sarah Richardson, New Kent, Va.)The book critic Ron Charles reflected on writers’ fears that artificial intelligence like ChatGPT will replace or marginalize them: “These are antique concerns, I know. Economists assure us that all those Luddite weavers in Nottingham eventually got better jobs spinning websites in Mountain View. But that’s a long yarn.” (Scott Burt, Santa Fe, N.M., and Laurence Mate, Champaign, Ill.)And Alexandra Petri mused: “In ‘The Madness of King George,’ there are several scenes where very learned doctors dedicate considerable time and effort to squinting at the contents of the king’s chamber pot. Watching the movie, you think, ‘Well, at least we are at a stage of civilization where we don’t have to do that! We do not live in a world that hinges so completely on the condition of one or two powerful men that it is worth our while to spend hours every day examining their stools in minute detail and trying to draw conclusions from them.’ But then Elon Musk buys Twitter, and — I can think of no better analogy for what has ensued.” (Jennifer John, Troy, Mich.)In Slate, Justin Peters had his own fun with Twitter’s tempestuous titan: “Musk is the richest man in the world and yet comports himself online like a pustulous incel on a Mountain Dew bender.” (Disa Mouat, Atlanta, and Dan Coleman, Melbourne, Australia)Writing about the World Cup in The Guardian, Barney Ronay observed the French team’s reliance on “the deep bovine physical splendor of Olivier Giroud, a footballer who doesn’t exactly run, who never really ever ran, but instead rumbles grandly like a mahogany armoire being slid along a polished parquet floor.” (Pat Carroll, Harrisburg, Penn., and John Rowbottom, Mandurah, Australia)And in The Ringer, Brian Phillips traced one spectator’s arc during the climactic contest between France and Argentina: “Throughout the match, the camera kept cutting to the French president, Emmanuel Macron. At first he looked trim and professional, a politician making an official appearance; by the end of the game, he looked like he’d staggered out of a bar and into the chorus of a Tom Waits song.” (Phil Waters, Evergreen, Colo.)In a review of “Avatar: The Way of Water” in The New Yorker, Anthony Lane mentioned “a splendid moment when Jake’s adopted daughter, who is super-attuned to all sentient things, fends off a hostile human, beneath the waves, by urging a spindly invertebrate to wrap the attacker in its tendrils. Now you know: My enemy’s anemone is my friend.” (Kevin Quigley, Cortlandt Manor, N.Y., and John Kalish, Manhattan)To finish with The Times, Blake Hounshell remarked on the enhanced appreciation of President Biden since the midterms: “There are no honeymoons in American politics anymore. But President Biden is enjoying something akin to a post-wedding limo ride.” (Lisa Mullany, Point Lookout, N.Y., and Judy Brown, Sherman, Conn.)And Tressie McMillan Cottom offered her perspective on ChatGPT: “The history of technology says that these things have a hype cycle: They promise; we fear; they catch hold; they under-deliver. We right-size them. We get back to the business of being human, which is machine-proof.” (Paulette Sage, Cleveland)To nominate favorite bits of recent writing from The Times or other publications to be mentioned in “For the Love of Sentences,” please email me here , put “Sentences” in the subject line and include your name and place of residence.As I settled down to “The Banshees of Inisherin ,” I braced for the kind of emotional bludgeoning that its writer and director, Martin McDonagh, subjected me to in “Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.” 
3412	But this movie’s audaciously low-key and tonally risky story, in which a small change of heart yields a big crisis of identity, is less oppressive and more rewarding — it’s like a philosophy seminar rendered as a sporadically funny, fleetingly bloody and deeply sad Irish fable. 
3413	And the actors are glorious, especially Colin Farrell as a man trying to make sense of his rejection by his closest friend and Kerry Condon as his sister.Conversely, I had great expectations for “The Fabelmans”: I like intimate family dramas, I love  Michelle Williams, and a glimpse into Steven Spielberg’s formation as a filmmaker is a worthy focus, warranted by the majesty of his career. 
3414	But this particular glimpse struck me as somewhat dull and slightly precious, and Williams’s performance had uncharacteristically stagy, phony notes. 
3415	The ecstatic reviews for “The Fabelmans” perplex me.Speaking of glorious performances, Brian Tyree Henry’s in “Causeway” enlivens a movie that’s otherwise curiously inert. 
3416	He plays a New Orleans man who is haunted by a terrible accident in his past and finds a kindred spirit in a wounded military veteran (Jennifer Lawrence). 
3417	I wish the movie had given their characters more to say and do. 
3418	It mistakes stillness for gravitas, reticence for profundity. 
3419	Owen Gleiberman, in his review in Variety, cleverly placed “Causeway” in the category of “slow-burn nonverbal indie gloomfest.”But it’s nowhere near as frustrating as “Triangle of Sadness ,” a blunt examination of social and economic hierarchy among a yacht’s passengers and crew that sullies its many brilliant flourishes with punishingly overlong and crushingly unsubtle sequences. 
3420	I’d probably heard Elvis Costello’s ballad 1977 “Alison,” which got considerable exposure on the radio stations I listened to, and I’d surely stumbled across his 1979 hit single “Oliver’s Army.” 
3421	But I didn’t fully take notice of him until 1982, when he released his seventh studio album, “Imperial Bedroom,” and I read a rave review of it somewhere. 
3422	I bought it.The opening song, “Beyond Belief,” stunned me — in the best possible way. 
3423	Here are the first lines:History repeats the old conceitsThe glib replies, the same defeatsHere are another two, less than 30 seconds later:I hang around dying to be torturedYou’ll never be alone in the bone orchard How many other singer-songwriters drew on this kind of vocabulary? 
3424	How many fashioned lyrics so erudite? 
3425	No wonder he wore those bulky eyeglasses, the kind then associated with physics majors, not rock stars. 
3426	He was announcing his braininess. 
3427	In the decades since “Imperial Bedroom,” I’ve dipped in and out of Costello’s music, forgetting it for long stretches and then hearing a snippet and diving afresh into one of his dozens of albums. 
3428	They explore and straddle various genres. 
3429	They’re excellent and very good and OK. 
3430	But what they have in common is a particular intelligence, conspicuous and delightful in the way he plays with conventions, expectations and, above all, words.Not long after “Imperial Bedroom” came the album “Punch the Clock.” 
3431	Its standout single, “Everyday I Write the Book,” took the conceit of a relationship as a volume of prose to the metaphoric point where it relegated a “dreamboat” to a “footnote” and rhymed “equal” with “sequel.” 
3432	It also had this bright bit:You said you’d stand by meIn the middle of Chapter ThreeBut you were up to your old tricksIn Chapters Four, Five and Six Plenty of rockers and pop stars evoke thwarted passion or heady romance, and that’s often what I’m looking for. 
3433	But sometimes I’m in the mood for an archness that’s hummable, a mischievousness to which you can tap your feet. 
3434	That’s harder to find — and that’s where Elvis Costello comes in.
3435	(Thanks to Jon Dworkow of Westport, Conn., Keith Krabbe of Princeton, N.J., and Mike Brock of London, among others, for urging recognition of Costello.) 
3436	I have rolled the former feature “For the Love of Songs” into “On a Personal Note,” which will be dedicated to songs and musicians of your or my choosing every so often. 
3437	If you’ve sent in a recommendation over the past year, thank you — and please know that it has been saved. 
3438	I hope to get to it down the line.
3439	WASHINGTON — The I.R.S. subjected both President Donald J. Trump’s predecessor and his successor to annual audits of their tax returns once they took office, spokespeople for Barack Obama and President Biden said on Wednesday, intensifying questions about how Mr. Trump escaped such scrutiny until Democrats in the House started inquiring. 
3440	Late Tuesday, a House committee revealed that the I.R.S. failed to audit Mr. Trump during his first two years in office despite a rule that states that “the individual tax returns for the president and the vice president are subject to mandatory review.” 
3441	But its report left unclear whether that lapse reflected general dysfunction or whether Mr. Trump received special treatment. 
3442	The disclosure of routine audits of Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden during their time in office suggested that the agency’s treatment of Mr. Trump was an aberration.
3443	“I’m absolutely flabbergasted,” said Nina E. Olson, the national taxpayer advocate from 2001 to 2019. 
3444	“It’s disturbing. You have a process where you’re auditing the president, you better be auditing the president.” 
3445	Reports issued by the Ways and Means Committee, which obtained Mr. Trump’s tax data last month after a yearslong legal battle, said the I.R.S. had initiated its first audit of one of his filings as president in April 2019, the same day that Representative Richard E. Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts and the committee’s chairman, had inquired about the matter. 
3446	The I.R.S. has yet to complete that audit, the report added, and the agency started auditing filings covering Mr. Trump’s income while president only after he left office. 
3447	Even after the agency belatedly started looking, it assigned only a single agent to examine Mr. Trump’s returns, going up against a large team of lawyers and accountants who objected when the I.R.S. added two more people to help. 
3448	The committee’s discovery that the I.R.S. flouted its rules is bringing new scrutiny to concerns about potential politicization at the I.R.S. during the Trump administration and spurring calls for the inspector general that oversees the agency to investigate what went wrong. 
3449	It has also raised questions about why the I.R.S. devoted so few resources to auditing Mr. Trump, who, as a business mogul, had far more complicated tax filings than any previous president. 
3450	Under Mr. Trump, the I.R.S. was run for most of 2017 by a commissioner appointed by Mr. Obama, John Koskinen, and — after about 11 months being overseen by an acting head, David J. Kautter — a successor appointed by Mr. Trump, Charles P. Rettig. 
3451	None ensured that the agency followed its rules requiring presidential audits. 
3452	Mr. Rettig, who left in October, said in an email on Wednesday evening that he did not attempt to intervene in Mr. Trump’s audit.
3453	“I am not aware of any taxpayer receiving special treatment at any time, before or during my term as commissioner,” he said. 
3454	“Further, at no time did I make, nor am I aware that anyone else made, any decision to somehow limit resources available to conduct examinations under the mandatory examination process.”He added: “I had no involvement in the process of selecting for examination or the conduct of an examination of any return regarding any taxpayer.” 
3455	Mr. Koskinen said that his only involvement in Mr. Trump’s tax returns was working to ensure that they were kept in a secure location. 
3456	“The good thing about being commissioner is that you never know who is being audited,” Mr. Koskinen said, adding that it would have been inappropriate to ask about the status of any examination. 
3457	Mr. Kautter did not respond to a request for comment. 
3458	The committee’s reports left many questions unanswered given that it had little time to act: While Mr. Neal had sought Mr. Trump’s tax records since 2019, Mr. Trump fought that request for nearly four years. 
3459	The Ways and Means Committee only received access to the information last month, with Republicans set to take control of the House in January. 
3460	Spokespeople and associates of several other former presidents over the last three decades either did not respond on Wednesday to queries about whether those presidents had been audited every year they were in office or said they did not recall.Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, on Wednesday called the House panel’s findings a “blockbuster”  that required further attention.
3461	“The I.R.S. was asleep at the wheel, and the presidential audit program is broken,” he said. 
3462	“There is no justification for the failure to conduct the required presidential audits until a congressional inquiry was made.” 
3463	The Internal Revenue Service has already been the subject of repeated controversy.The New York Times reported this year that the I.R.S. had initiated particularly invasive audits of two of Mr. Trump’s perceived enemies, the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey and his deputy, Andrew G. McCabe. 
3464	Mr. Trump also repeatedly told his chief of staff that he wanted his perceived rivals , including those two, to face tax investigations.Despite the low odds of both being singled out, an inspector general’s report concluded  that both had been randomly selected for the initial pools from which the agency drew to carry out the examinations. 
3465	But it is unclear how the I.R.S. made final selections from those pools.In 2019, Mr. Trump raised eyebrows  by telling Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, to prioritize a confirmation vote for a longtime associate, Michael J. Desmond, as general counsel of the I.R.S. over the nomination of William P. Barr as attorney general. 
3466	Mr. Desmond had advised a subsidiary of the Trump Organization and worked with two of its tax lawyers.And in 2018, Mr. Trump appointed as commissioner Mr. Rettig, who had written a Forbes column in 2016 defending Mr. Trump’s refusal to release his taxes  as a candidate and portrayed the I.R.S. as fully engaged in auditing very wealthy people.
3467	“Teams of sophisticated tax advisers were likely engaged throughout Trump’s career to assure the absence of any ‘bombshell’ within the returns,” Mr. Rettig wrote. 
3468	“His returns might actually be somewhat unremarkable but for the fact they are the returns of Donald Trump.”In fact, the few glimpses of Mr. Trump’s taxes have shown much to talk about. 
3469	The Trump Organization was convicted of a tax fraud scheme this month. 
3470	The New York attorney general has sued Mr. Trump and three of his children , accusing them of fraudulently overvaluing his assets. 
3471	The Times gained access to years of his tax information and published a report in September 2020 that raised numerous questions about the legality of write-offs and deductions he had used to avoid paying any taxes most years. 
3472	The article prompted the I.R.S. to consider looking at Mr. Trump’s 2017 tax returns, the committee report said. 
3473	The I.R.S. has had scant resources for years because Republicans have sought to cut its funding. 
3474	The report highlighted the agency’s broader struggles in dealing with complicated tax returns filed by wealthy people and criticized its willingness to trust that returns filed by big accounting firms contained accurate information. 
3475	Congress has approved an $80 billion overhaul of the I.R.S. intended in part to hire more specialists capable of auditing high-income filers. 
3476	The committee released the reports after a party-line vote, exercising a rarely used power to obtain and make public any U.S. taxpayer’s private information. 
3477	Congress invoked it in 1974, when a committee released a report about President Richard M. Nixon’s taxes after a scandal about whether he was underpaying what he owed. 
3478	That scandal led the I.R.S. in 1977 to create its rule mandating audits of presidents and vice presidents, ensuring that agency officials are not put in the awkward position of deciding whether to audit their boss.The Ways and Means Committee again used that authority in 2014, when Republicans accused the I.R.S. of political discrimination because it used conservative terms like “tea party” when selecting groups to scrutinize for political activities that would make them ineligible to receive tax-deductible donations. 
3479	But an inspector general determined  that the agency had also used liberal terms, like “progressive” and “occupy,” for the same purpose. 
3480	Commissioners of the agency are political appointees of presidents. 
3481	Mr. Koskinen — who had also run the agency several of the years that it was routinely auditing Mr. Obama — was not the only one to say he avoided involvement in presidential audits. 
3482	Charles O. Rossotti, who served as I.R.S. commissioner from 1997 to 2002, said that he was aware that presidents were audited as a matter of practice but that he played no role in the process. 
3483	“I kept away from that with a 10-foot pole,” Mr. Rossotti said. 
3484	The requirement that presidential returns be audited is included in the tax agency’s Internal Review Manual, which offers few details. 
3485	A 2019 I.R.S. document accompanying the committee report said the examinations were conducted by experienced revenue agents. 
3486	“The I.R.S. is not aware of any reports of improper bias or partiality in the conduct of an officeholder’s examination in the more than 40-year history of the mandatory procedures,” it said. 
3487	The House committee report also documented an extraordinary lack of resources the I.R.S. dedicated to auditing Mr. Trump’s returns when it belatedly started doing so, initially assigning just one staff member to the matter despite the unusual complexity of his business entities and partnerships. 
3488	The committee cited internal I.R.S. memos stating that “it is not possible to obtain the resources available to examine all potential issues” raised by the more than 400 pass-through entities cited in Mr. Trump’s taxes. 
3489	“To do a thorough review of these returns, we would need a team much larger than the current team,” it said.
3490	Mike Hodges, a director whose visceral feature-film debut, “Get Carter” (1971), is regarded as one of Britain’s best gangster movies, died on Saturday at his home in Dorset, England. 
3491	He was 90. 
3492	Mike Kaplan, a longtime friend and a producer of Mr. Hodges’s 2004 film, “I’ll Sleep When I’m Dead,” said the cause was heart failure.Mr. 
3493	Hodges wasn’t prolific — writing about him in The New York Times  in 2004, the critic Terrence Rafferty said, “The English director Mike Hodges has made so few films he should be legendary,” like Stanley Kubrick and other limited-output directors. 
3494	But he had successes, none bigger than his feature debut. 
3495	Mr. Hodges had directed for a handful of British television series when he stepped up in class with “Get Carter,” a movie he wrote based on a novel by Ted Lewis. 
3496	Michael Caine starred as a criminal out to avenge his brother, who had died under suspicious circumstances.
3497	“Its violence is so ghastly and unremitting and its view of the human condition is so perfectly vile that one would almost rather wash one’s mouth out with soap than recommend it,” Peter Schjeldahl wrote in The Times when the movie came out. 
3498	“Yet it is so finely acted and crafted — and is so spectacularly better than the run of its genre — that as a lover of movies one feels practically duty‐bound to sing its praises.” 
3499	After “Pulp” (1972), a crime comedy that also starred Mr. Caine, and “The Terminal Man” (1974), a blend of science fiction and horror based on a Michael Crichton novel, Mr. Hodges took on a high-profile assignment, the big-budget sci-fi yarn “Flash Gordon.” 
3500	Released in 1980, the movie divided critics.
3501	“It means to be escapist entertainment,” Vincent Canby of The Times wrote, “but it’s all so extravagantly witless that it stirs the social conscience, if not too deeply. It reminds you that there are people in India who would be glad to eat the spinach you leave on your plate.” 
3502	But Roger Ebert of The Chicago Sun-Times admired Mr. Hodges’s campy take on the story, which was based on the popular comic strip of the same name.
3503	“At a time when ‘Star Wars’ and its spinoffs have inspired special effects men to bust a gut making their interplanetary adventures look real, ‘Flash Gordon’ is cheerfully willing to look as phony as it is,” he wrote. 
3504	“I don’t mean that as a criticism.” 
3505	Later in the 1980s Mr. Hodges made some flops, including the sci-fi comedy “Morons From Outer Space” (1985) and the crime drama “A Prayer for the Dying” (1987), which he disowned because he objected to the editing. 
3506	But “Croupier” (1998), a crime drama about a writer (Clive Owen) who goes to work in a casino, brought him a burst of new attention. 
3507	The movie didn’t get much notice when it had a limited release in Europe, but then a friend found an American distributor willing to give it a two-week run in some markets in the United States, and critics hailed a comeback.
3508	“‘Croupier,’ filmed by Mr. Hodges from a screenplay by Paul Mayersberg, shows that the director hasn’t lost his knack for whip-smart, tongue-in-cheek suspense,” Stephen Holden wrote in The Times  in 2000. 
3509	Mr. Hodges said that until those American reviews, his disappointment over the original lack of attention to “Croupier” had him considering quitting the business.
3510	“I was sitting at home in Dorset, getting over a hip replacement,” he told The Daily Telegraph of Britain in 2001, “and these amazing notices from America started pouring from my fax machine. I couldn’t believe it. It was like some crazy fairy tale.” 
3511	Yet he directed only one more feature, “I’ll Sleep When I’m Dead,” which also starred Mr. Owen, as a gangster who investigates his brother’s suicide. 
3512	With a plot not unlike that of “Get Carter,” it seemed like completing a circle.
3513	“It’s hard not to see ‘I’ll Sleep’ as a kind of unofficial sequel to ‘Get Carter,’” 
3514	Xan Brooks wrote in The Guardian in 2003. 
3515	“The film plays as a wearied elegy to the gangster life, full of characters slightly past their sell-by dates, angry and outmoded as they nurse their ancient feuds and clamber in and out of their E-type Jags. Hodges watches their decline with a cool, clinical eye.” 
3516	Michael Tommy Hodges was born on July 29, 1932, in Bristol, England, to Sandy and Norah Hodges. 
3517	His father was a cigarette salesman, his mother a homemaker. 
3518	He grew up watching the westerns and musicals of the 1940s and set his sights on becoming a director, though at his father’s urging he studied accounting for a time. 
3519	He had grown up in Salisbury and Bath — “cities with soft centers,” as he put it — but in the mid-1950s, two years of national service in the Royal Navy, which sent him to “every fishing port in the U.K,” opened his eyes to a rugged, saltier side of life, an experience later reflected in his films. 
3520	After the Navy he got a job as a teleprompter operator for the BBC in London, which introduced him to television. 
3521	He began writing advertising copy and was eventually producing and directing. 
3522	In 1999, when a retrospective of Mr. Hodges’s movies was showing in Los Angeles, Kevin Thomas of The Los Angeles Times said that the crime films stood out for their complexity and ambiguity.
3523	“Just when you think Hodges is building to a payoff that will clear everything up,” he wrote, “he may leave you to sort things out for yourself.” 
3524	Mr. Hodges’s first marriage, to Jean Alexandrov, ended in divorce. 
3525	He is survived by his wife, Carol Laws; two sons from his first marriage, Ben and Jake; and five grandchildren. 
3526	Mr. Hodges reflected on his career in an interview with The Evening Standard of Britain in 1999.“I’m always astonished that my messages in bottles, as I think of my films, ever got off the ground at all,” he said. 
3527	“Astonished, but very happy too.”
3528	Caleb and Kate get into a terrible argument. 
3529	Like most couples, they “loved each other, but not every single minute.” 
3530	Caleb storms out, “hating his wife from top to bottom,” but he soon cools off, having forgotten what the fight was even about. 
3531	Before he returns to make up with Kate, however, he sits down to rest, and while he’s dozing, a passing witch casts a spell. 
3532	When the unsuspecting Caleb wakes up, he’s a dog.Well, these things happen — in children’s books. 
3533	But while stupid fights, witches and magic spells are all common elements in stories for young people, what’s uncommon about William Steig’s 1977 picture book, “Caleb and Kate,”  is that not a single child appears in its pages. 
3534	Nor do they in several of Steig’s other beloved children’s books, at least not as main characters, whether monsters (“Shrek!”) or not.
3535	“I never am trying to get anything across,” William Steig said of “Caleb and Kate” in an interview at the time. 
3536	“I think it’s deadly. It ruins writing to have purposes like that.” 
3537	Steig may not have been trying to send a message to children, but children got the message anyway. 
3538	“Caleb and Kate” acknowledges a world in which adults — even a reader’s parents — fight, but the world doesn’t end when they do. 
3539	Moreover, it suggests that grown-up fights can be just as ludicrous as children’s squabbles, and adults can behave in equally rash and regrettable ways. 
3540	They’re just grown-ups, after all — and this is both comforting and amusing information for children to absorb.
3541	“Children see the adult world as mysterious and fascinating — and one they want to know,” said Leonard Marcus, a historian of children’s literature. 
3542	“To be able to see into this secret world through children’s books creates a kind of empathy.”Yet the adult protagonist has become a rare figure in American children’s books. 
3543	With a few notable exceptions — “A Sick Day for Amos McGee” by Philip C. Stead and Erin E. Stead, and several titles by the author-illustrator Jon Agee come to mind — most children’s books today are deeply child-centric. 
3544	This shift began in the 1960s, with the rise of developmental psychology, and intensified from the 1980s onward. 
3545	“It’s become kind of codified that books for children should be about  young children,” Marcus said, with a rule of thumb holding that the protagonist, whether animal or human, be the same age or slightly older than the reader.But that’s a rule worth questioning. 
3546	Some might see the entrenchment of child-centeredness in children’s literature as reinforcing what some social critics consider a rising tide of narcissism in young people today. 
3547	But to be fair: Such criticisms of youth transcend the ages. 
3548	What is certainly true now is the primacy of “mirrors and windows,”  a philosophy that strives to show children characters who reflect how they look back to them, as well as those from different backgrounds, mostly with an eye to diversity. 
3549	This is a noble goal, but those mirrors and windows should apply to adults as well. 
3550	Adults are, after all, central figures in children’s lives — their parents and caregivers, their teachers, their role models. 
3551	They are also children’s future selves. 
3552	What better way to understand these overgrown children than to inhabit their points of view? 
3553	And yes, adults are often the Other — which makes them a mystery and a curiosity. 
3554	Literature offers insight into these occasionally intimidating creatures.The adult figures in children’s literature are also frequently outsiders or eccentrics in some way, and quite often subject to ridicule. 
3555	They are the house painter Mr. Popper, who finds himself living with 12 penguins. 
3556	They are boring Officer Buckle , who just wants to impart safety tips. 
3557	The implicit lesson is that grown-ups aren’t infallible. 
3558	It’s OK to laugh at them and it’s OK to feel compassion for them and it’s even OK to feel sorry for them on occasion.In one of my favorite picture books, “The Story of Mrs. Lovewright and Purrless Her Cat,”  written by Lore Segal and illustrated by Paul O. Zelinsky, the dour Mrs. Lovewright is seemingly without company other than that of the grocery deliveryman Dylan — until he delivers a kitten at her request. 
3559	“I don’t care what color so it’s little and cute and purrs on my lap,” she instructs him. 
3560	She names her tabby Purrly so that he knows what he must do. 
3561	But she quickly learns what every child must learn: You cannot force anyone — animal or human — to do exactly what you want, let alone to love you as you demand. 
3562	It’s a profound lesson, more easily absorbed when delivered by a fussy old lady with flawed assumptions. 
3563	In real life, children revere adults and they fear them. 
3564	It only follows, then, that they appreciate when adult characters behave admirably but also delight in seeing the consequences — especially when rendered with humor — when they don’t. 
3565	Nursery rhymes, folk tales, myths and legends overwhelmingly cast adults as their central characters — and have endured for good reason. 
3566	Think the old woman who lived in the shoe and the villagers who prepare stone soup. 
3567	For decades, children have gravitated toward the fully adult gods and goddesses of ancient Greece, Rome, Egypt and Scandinavia and have gathered at the round table in King Arthur’s court.In somewhat later tales, children investigated crimes alongside Sherlock Holmes, adventured through Narnia, inhabited Oz and traversed Middle-earth. 
3568	Grown-up heroes can be hobbits, or rabbits (“Watership Down”), badgers or moles (“The Wind in the Willows”). 
3569	Children join them no matter what because they like to be in league with their protagonists and by extension, their authors. 
3570	As John Updike once wrote, in a children’s book review for The New York Times, “All successful children’s literature has a conspiratorial element.” 
3571	In children’s books with adult heroes, children get to conspire alongside their elders. 
3572	Defying the too-often adversarial relationship between adults and children in literature, such books enable children to see that adults are perfectly capable of occupying their shared world with less antagonism — as partners in life, in love and in adventure.

3609	No one could sing like Whitney Houston, and Kasi Lemmons, the director of the biopic “Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance With Somebody,” only rarely asks her lead, Naomi Ackie, to try. 
3610	This is a jukebox retelling of Houston’s parabola from sweatshirts to sequins, from church choir girl to tabloid fixture, from her teenage romance with Robyn Crawford (Nafessa Williams), the woman who would continue on as her creative director, to her volatile marriage to Bobby Brown (Ashton Sanders), who slithers into the movie licking his lips like he’s hungry to eat her alive. 
3611	Those beats are here. 
3612	But it’s the melodies that matter, those moments when Ackie opens her mouth to channel Houston’s previously recorded songs. 
3613	We’ve heard Houston’s rendition of “I Will Always Love You” countless times, and Lemmons bets, correctly, that the beloved hit will still seize us by the heart during the rather forthright montage she pairs with it, images of Houston marrying Brown, birthing her daughter Bobbi Kristina and honoring Nelson Mandela underneath a sky filled with fireworks.Ackie doesn’t much resemble the superstar, although her carriage is correct: eyes closed, head flung back, arms pushing away the air as if to make room for that mezzo-soprano. 
3614	That the film sticks to Houston’s surfaces is half excusable. 
3615	The screenwriter Anthony McCarten seems to find that the woman underneath the pop star shell was still struggling to define herself at the time of her death at the age of 48. 
3616	We see her raised to be the mini-me of her mother, the singer Cissy Houston (Tamara Tunie), complete with matching haircut, and then handed over to a recording label to be transformed into America’s Princess, a crown she wore with hesitance, and, later, resentment. 
3617	(Stanley Tucci plays her friendly, Fagin-with-a-combover Clive Davis of Arista Records, who also produced this film.) 
3618	At Houston’s final “Oprah” performance, recreated here, she belts an earnest ballad called, “I Didn’t Know My Own Strength.”Houston didn’t write her own material; she just sang like she did, courtesy of Cissy’s fastidious coaching. 
3619	“God gives you a gift, you got to use it right,” Cissy lectures. 
3620	Yet, Houston as seen here can only say yes or no to other people’s ideas of what she should sing, wear and do. 
3621	(A camera pan suggests, unconvincingly, that Houston thought of the film’s title track as a love song to Crawford.) 
3622	Increasingly, she chooses opposition. 
3623	Her successes are shared — and her money swallowed up by her father (Clarke Peters), who was also her manager — but her mistakes are all hers. 
3624	(Even though Lemmons takes care to include a scene in which Houston absolves Brown of her crack addiction.) 
3625	Houston’s defiance is the movie’s attempt to answer the great mystery of her career: why she deliberately damaged her voice through smoking and hard drugs. 
3626	“It’s like leaving a Stradivarius in the rain!” 
3627	Davis yelps. 
3628	The trouble with a gift, the film decides, is it went undervalued by Houston herself, who assumes she’ll be able to hit bombastic high notes every night of her poorly reviewed final world tour. 
3629	In this doomed stretch, the camera creeps so close to Ackie that you can count the beads of sweat on her nose. 
3630	The smothering is heavy-handed, yet apropos for an artist who never had the space, or creative motivation, to fully express herself.Whitney Houston: I Wanna Dance With Somebody Rated PG-13 for drugs, cigarettes and swearing. 
3631	Running time: 2 hours 26 minutes. 
3632	In theaters.
3633	Pop in 2022 was unequivocally dominated by the Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny. 
3634	Songs from his latest album, “Un Verano Sin Ti” (“A Summer Without You”), were streamed billions of times, keeping it at No. 1 on the Billboard album chart for much of the year; his tours and other live performances grossed $435 million, according to Billboard Boxscore . 
3635	Even so, his triumph was anything but a surprise. 
3636	Every one of the six albums that the artist, born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio, has released since 2018 has been a billion-streamer. 
3637	Yet he has stuck to lyrics in Spanish. 
3638	Unlike prior waves of Latin pop hitmakers who have reached a wider United States market, Bad Bunny is very clearly not bothering to court an English-language crossover. 
3639	The world is listening anyway.Bad Bunny’s voice — a rich baritone groan that can sound both supremely confident and perpetually unsatisfied — has become one of the most recognizable sounds of the 21st century, at home in every collaboration and any idiom he chooses, from reggaeton to punk-pop. 
3640	He has built a persona as a hard-partying, raunchy, fashion-forward Casanova who also speaks out about Puerto Rico’s pride and frustrations. 
3641	And the commercial success of “Un Verano Sin Ti” was so undeniable that it became the first release performed entirely in Spanish to receive a Grammy nomination  for album of the year.That’s a very belated milestone. 
3642	It’s also just a hint of how much diverse, brilliant Spanish-language pop appeared in 2022: from forward-looking pop contenders like Rosalía and Rauw Alejandro; from introspective yet sonically ambitious songwriters like Carla Morrison  and iLe; and from experimental composers like Lucrecia Dalt. 
3643	Drawing freely and idiosyncratically on tradition, all of them have found ways to recast multigenerational lore into music for the here and now. 
3644	Latin music — a purposely loose category that encompasses countless national, regional and local styles — has always pointed toward joyful innovation. 
3645	Across the Americas, historical forces including colonialism, slavery, Indigenous perseverance and cultural and individual resourcefulness forged music that is richly, creatively hybridized. 
3646	Latin music has long proved that the fusions broaden connections.In 1938, the New Orleans pianist and composer Jelly Roll Morton, speaking about the origins of jazz, told Alan Lomax, “If you can’t manage to put tinges of Spanish in your tunes, you will never be able to get the right seasoning, I call it, for jazz.” 
3647	What Morton called the “Spanish tinge” actually came from Afro-Cuban rhythms like the habanera. 
3648	Rhythms, dynamics, melodic contours, vocal inflections and other ideas from Latin music have repeatedly catalyzed mainstream musical evolution: in jazz, rock ’n’ roll, psychedelia, disco, electronic dance music and hip-hop. 
3649	Current pop has found an international common denominator in the reggaeton beat that emerged decades ago in Panama and Puerto Rico. 
3650	Now it just sounds like an eternal, syncopated pulse. 
3651	In the era of streaming and the internet, Latin music has reconfigured the meaning of regional styles. 
3652	A particular beat or a standard instrumental lineup — a cumbia by a mariachi band, or a bachata with electric guitar and bongos — still points clearly to a singular place of origin, to Mexico or the Dominican Republic. 
3653	But musicians aren’t confining themselves to homeland styles or shunning outsiders. 
3654	With everything available for listening or sampling or layering, far more boundary-hopping now takes place; Bad Bunny’s album, for instance, focuses on reggaeton but also dips into bachata, cumbia and merengue. 
3655	In the best new Latin pop, genre-hopping and genre-splicing are clearly a matter of musical curiosity and shared intentions, not crossover calculation.The Spanish songwriter Rosalía made it her game plan to jump-cut among styles on her profoundly and playfully self-conscious 2022 album, “Motomami.” 
3656	The songs constantly, willfully mutate, using the flamenco Rosalía studied in Spain along with reggaeton, bachata, piano ballads, jazz, hip-hop and salsa. 
3657	On “Motomami” she sings about her determination to transform, her sudden global fame  and how fleeting it could be; she also throws in some Japanese references, in case anyone thought she was limited to Europe and the Americas. 
3658	Each allusion has clearly recognizable roots, but Rosalía insists that their contrasts add up to something more: a common humanity, even if it’s digitally mediated.The Puerto Rican singer, songwriter and producer Rauw Alejandro steered his pop-reggaeton toward electronic realms on his 2022 album, “Saturno.” 
3659	He nodded toward reggaeton predecessors — one of the album’s hits, “Punto 40,” radically updated a 1998 song in collaboration with its originator, Baby Rasta — but he also deployed synthesizers to go hopscotching through styles like electro- and hyperpop, sometimes dissolving the beat to trade typical reggaeton braggadocio for lost-in-space heartache .
3660	Eerie electronic backdrops merged with Latin rhythms to heighten the intimacy of 2022 albums like “Nacarile,” by the Puerto Rican songwriter iLe (Ileana Cabra), and “El Renacimiento,” by the Mexican songwriter Carla Morrison. 
3661	ILe touched down in established styles like reggaeton (in a duet with the Puerto Rican reggaeton pioneer Ivy Queen) and bolero (in a duet with the Chilean songwriter Mon Laferte), but also created otherworldly new hybrids, floating her voice within a phantom chorale in songs that explored temptation and oppression. 
3662	On “El Renacimiento” (“The Rebirth”), Morrison sang about overcoming doubts and anxieties  in music that seemed to hover around her protectively, invoking traditional rhythms from a great distance.Lucrecia Dalt, a Colombian composer and singer now based in Berlin, took tradition and abstraction even further on her 2022 concept album, “Ay!.”  It sketches a story of an alien entity of pure consciousness that comes to Earth and experiences time and corporeality as new sensations. 
3663	The music deals in skewed memories and sensations; it often harks back to vintage Latin styles, using acoustic instruments but warping the tempos and toying with perceived space. 
3664	It’s deeply aware of the music’s past, but not constrained by it. 
3665	As Latin pop flexes both its inventiveness and its commercial clout, crass imitations and dilutions are bound to appear. 
3666	There will inevitably be questions about who profits and who deserves credit.Bad Bunny, for one, isn’t threatened. 
3667	One of the most hard-hitting songs on “Un Verano Sin Ti” is “El Apagón,”  which means “The Blackout” — an irate reference to the frequent power failures that have plagued Puerto Rico since Hurricane Maria in 2017. 
3668	The track begins with a stark, traditional Puerto Rican beat, a bomba, as Bad Bunny praises the island’s people, culture and spunk. 
3669	Midway through, it switches into buzzing, blasting, big-room EDM — as if leaping from ritual to rave — but not before Bad Bunny makes a point Jelly Roll Morton might well have respected.
3670	“Ahora todos quieren ser latinos/No, ey, pero les falta sazón,” Bad Bunny chants. 
3671	“Now everybody wants to be Latin, but they don’t have the seasoning.”
3672	Volodymyr Zelensky, the Ukrainian president, made a risky journey yesterday to Washington, where he met with President Biden and addressed a joint session of Congress in a bid to rally support for his country’s war effort. 
3673	After their meeting, Biden said the U.S. would continue to support Ukraine “for as long as it takes.”Zelensky, asked what he would consider a fair way to end the war, said that he would not compromise the sovereignty, freedom and territorial integrity of his country. 
3674	He said Ukraine shared values with the U.S. and was fighting “for our common victory against this tyranny.” 
3675	The meeting came after the secretary of state, Antony Blinken, announced that the U.S. was sending Ukraine an additional $1.8 billion in military aid, including a Patriot missile battery, one of the most advanced U.S. air defense systems. 
3676	Zelensky said he intended to ask for another Patriot battery. 
3677	“We are in war — I am really sorry,” he said.Response: Dmitri Peskov, the Kremlin’s spokesman, said on Wednesday that deliveries of new U.S. weapons, including the Patriot missile battery, would lead “to an aggravation of the conflict” and did “not bode well for Ukraine.”In other news from the war:Ukrainian troops will most likely find it more challenging to reclaim territory  from Russian forces who are now focused on defending their remaining land gains, American officials said.Vladimir Putin, the Russian president, acknowledged that his country’s military lacked the equipment and technology  necessary to win but pledged to increase funding for the war.Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister, announced yesterday that he had succeeded in forming a coalition government . 
3678	It is set to bring him back to power at the helm of the most right-wing administration in Israeli history, 18 months after he left office. 
3679	Netanyahu will lead a hard-line, six-party coalition whose members seek to upend the judicial system, reduce Palestinian autonomy in the occupied West Bank, further strengthen Israel’s Jewish character and maximize state support for the most religious Jews. 
3680	It would be Israel’s first ideologically cohesive government since 2019. 
3681	Analysts say that will not necessarily provide political stability. 
3682	Despite their relative homogeneity, the coalition’s members frequently disagreed over policy during negotiations and took more than six weeks to formalize their partnership. 
3683	Its formation also puts the country on course for a constitutional showdown between the government and the judiciary.Quotable:  Netanyahu announced the deal minutes before a midnight deadline last night. 
3684	“I have been able to form a government that will act in the interest of all citizens of Israel,” he told Isaac Herzog, the country’s president.Charges:  Netanyahu is on trial for corruption. 
3685	He denies any intention to use his office to influence the proceedings, but other members of his coalition have pledged to legalize some of the crimes of which he is accused and to reduce the influence of the attorney general, who is overseeing Netanyahu’s prosecution.Donald Trump paid $1.1 million in federal income taxes in his first three years  as president and no taxes at all in 2020 as his income began to dwindle, according to a report by the House Ways and Means Committee. 
3686	And in the two years before he became president, Trump experienced heavy business losses, the records showed.At first glance, the income-tax data seems to show a turnaround in 2018, after a decade in which Trump declared no taxable income. 
3687	In fact, his year in the black appears to have resulted from the final windfall of the vast inheritance that financed much of his business career  — more than $14 million in gains from the sale of a 1970s investment by his father.Audit: The U.S. tax agency delayed auditing Trump during his first two years  in office despite a program that requires that it do so for sitting presidents. 
3688	The I.R.S. has yet to complete those audits, it said, and started auditing filings covering Trump’s income while he was president only after he had left office.Around the WorldArgentines flocked to welcome home the national soccer team  after its World Cup win.Even Hungary’s more prosperous cities are struggling  as inflation reaches 22 percent and the economy tips toward recession.Eight teenage girls have been charged with murder in the stabbing of a man  over a bottle of liquor in Toronto.Russian hackers breached the taxi dispatch system  at J.F.K. airport in New York and charged cabdrivers $10 to jump the line.Other Big StoriesThousands of ambulance workers in England and Wales went on strike to demand pay increases  and better working conditions.Issues at Tesla, the world’s most valuable car company, are complicating its reputation as the clear leader in electric vehicles .

3714	In his dramatic, daylong visit to Washington, President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine sought to bring the sounds and smells of the war’s front lines to the decision makers in White House and the Congress, who he said had the ability to speed up Ukraine’s victory and bring the war to an end.
3715	“Every inch of that land is soaked in blood; roaring guns sound every hour,” he said of Bakhmut in the country’s east, where his army is holding ground in one of the bloodiest campaigns of the war. 
3716	“The Russians’ tactic is primitive. They burn down and destroy everything they see.” 
3717	While support for Ukraine has broad support in Congress, some Republican lawmakers have been outspoken about their opposition to sending more money abroad. 
3718	While it was not immediately clear if Mr. Zelensky’s pleas had changed any of their minds, he did take home at least one significant boost: a pledge to supply Ukraine with an advanced Patriot air-defense system , which will improve Ukraine’s ability to counter the missiles and drones that Russia fires at the nation’s energy infrastructure, deepening the suffering of civilians as temperatures dip during the winter.
3719	“If your Patriots stop the Russian terror against our cities, it will let Ukrainian patriots work to the full to defend our freedom,” the Ukrainian leader said in his speech to Congress. 
3720	“When Russia cannot reach our cities by its artillery, it tries to destroy them with missile attacks.” 
3721	The trip, a risky gambit coordinated in stealth, was also a projection of strength and confidence amid the daily blare of air-raid sirens from Russian attacks and persistent power outages.
3722	“Each word was charged with Ukraine’s overwhelming energy and spirit,” Ukraine’s foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, wrote on Twitter. 
3723	“May it inspire millions of people in the U.S. and around the globe to protect what we all hold dear: freedom.”
3724	CARACAS, Venezuela — Juan Guaidó swept to international renown in 2019 during a euphoric anti-government protest when he declared Venezuela’s authoritarian president an illegitimate leader and himself  the interim leader. 
3725	It was a major and bold move backed by the United States and dozens of other nations and the most serious threat to President Nicolás Maduro’s authoritarian government. 
3726	But on Thursday, with Mr. Maduro still firmly in place, it seemed Mr. Guaidó’s mandate might be nearing its end.In a vote held by the opposition legislature that exists parallel to Mr. Maduro’s government, Mr. Guaidó’s own colleagues voted overwhelmingly to end his interim government . 
3727	The decision is not final: A second session scheduled for Dec. 29 will have to confirm it, though analysts believe the initial vote will likely stand. 
3728	But it was the clearest sign yet that most of the Venezuelan opposition believes that Mr. Guaidó cannot achieve their stated goal — Mr. Maduro’s ouster and the restoration of democracy — and that they must pursue a different strategy. 
3729	It was also a blow to the United States, which threw its support steadfastly behind Mr. Guaidó and continues to call him the country’s interim president, even as other nations have backed away from that recognition. 
3730	A representative of the U.S. Embassy to Venezuela did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
3731	A total of 72 representatives voted Thursday to eliminate the interim government, while 24 voted to keep it and nine voted to abstain.In a message to the public, the three opposition political parties supporting the end of the interim government said that the “political process” that began four years ago with the recognition of Mr. Guaidó as president “is not perceived as an option for real political change.” 
3732	The strategy in place under Mr. Guaidó “has not reached the expected liberation objectives and the country demands new paths that lead us toward democracy,” the message continued. 
3733	Venezuela has been in the grips of an economic, political and humanitarian crisis since 2014, led by a government claiming socialist ideals that has gutted the country’s democratic institutions and left much of the country impoverished. 
3734	Seven million people, a quarter of the population, have fled in recent years, with a growing number of them headed toward the United States. 
3735	In 2019, Mr. Guaidó, a student activist turned legislator, took the helm of the country’s legislature, then the last major institution in the country controlled by the opposition.Amid large-scale protests against the Maduro government, he invoked an article of the Constitution  that transfers power to the head of the National Assembly if the presidency becomes vacant. 
3736	A 2018 election won by Mr. Maduro had already been declared a sham by the United States, the European Union, the Organization of American States and others, and Mr. Guaidó used that to claim that the president’s mandate was illegitimate. 
3737	Mr. Guaidó soon had an outpouring of support from Venezuelans, the diplomatic recognition of around 60 countries and staunch American backing — and was able to temporarily unite the country’s fractured opposition. 
3738	For a moment, a nation  crushed by repression and economic collapse saw hope. 
3739	Since then, the opposition has succeeded in getting Mr. Maduro to agree to a political dialogue in Mexico, which is set to continue next month after being stalled for more than a year. 
3740	As a part of those talks, Mr. Maduro has agreed to allow some Venezuelan funds frozen abroad to be used as humanitarian aid to help alleviate hunger and other travails faced by the country. 
3741	While this is regarded as a concession, the opposition is still far from its ultimate goal: Mr. Maduro’s removal. 
3742	Opposition leaders are pushing him toward allowing free and fair conditions for a presidential election that is already scheduled in 2024.In an interview with The New York Times  at his home in Caracas, the capital, last year, Mr. Guaidó said that unrelenting government persecution had dismantled his entourage and targeted his family. 
3743	His chief of staff and his uncle had both spent months in detention. 
3744	Most of his advisers and close relatives had fled the country.
3745	“The worst thing,” he added, thinking of his toddler daughter, “is having to explain to a child why the police follow her.”He continued: “This has been a great sacrifice, but I’d repeat it a thousand times.”Isayen Herrera reported from Caracas, Venezuela, and Julie Turkewitz  from Bogotá, Colombia.
3746	Alexei Ratmansky, one of the greatest living ballet choreographers, is leaving the American Ballet Theater after 13 years as its artist in residence, the company said on Thursday, noting that it was losing a towering figure who had been a profound creative force. 
3747	“Alexei’s extraordinary vision of dance has propelled ballet to heights far beyond what we thought was possible 20 years ago,” Susan Jaffe, the incoming artistic director of American Ballet Theater, said in a statement, adding that his works had “brought ballet into a new era.” 
3748	The company said Ratmansky would leave in June.During his long career, Ratmansky, 54, has been lauded for his energy, wit and technical virtuosity, as well as for the eclecticism of his interests, from the revival of forgotten works — including Shostakovich’s ballet “The Bright Stream” for the Bolshoi — to the creation of ballets that draw on both the past and the present, like his “Shostakovich Trilogy” and “Songs of Bukovina ” for American Ballet Theater. 
3749	“I will always be grateful for my time here,” he said in a statement on Thursday.Announcing his departure, the company said that Ratmansky had been an immeasurable influence and had choreographed numerous ballets, among them classics like “The Nutcracker,” which he reimagined, and “The Sleeping Beauty,”  in an opulent production that sought to go back to its original choreography. 
3750	He had also been an innovator, refashioning works for the pandemic age. 
3751	“Bernstein in a Bubble,” a playful virtual ballet set to music by Leonard Bernstein, was filmed without a live audience during the coronavirus pandemic and presented in March 2021 as part of a performance called “A.B.T. Live From City Center: A Ratmansky Celebration.” 
3752	In the coming months, American Ballet Theater will also be performing Ratmansky’s “Songs of Bukovina,” a suite of dances set to preludes loosely based on Ukrainian folk songs, in Chicago, Iowa City and Stony Brook, N.Y.Ratmansky’s work took on added resonance after Russia invaded Ukraine, with Ratmansky, who grew up in Kyiv and trained in Moscow, becoming an ardent supporter of Ukraine. 
3753	When the invasion began, he was in Moscow working at the Bolshoi Ballet, where he had once been the artistic director; he left immediately and said he was unlikely to return as long as President Vladimir V. Putin remained in the Kremlin. 
3754	He has also supported Ukraine by building The United Ukrainian Ballet Company , and staging “Giselle” with a group made up of Ukrainian refugees.
3755	“It was exactly like the world was crashing down,” he said of the first morning of the war. 
3756	“The fact that Russia was bombing Kyiv, where my parents and sister live, and that my family’s life was in danger, was just too overwhelming.”
3757	A Nepali court has ordered the release of the French killer Charles Sobhraj, cutting short the life sentence he had been serving for the murder of an American tourist. 
3758	The police believed that Mr. Sobhraj killed as many as 20 people in the 1970s and ’80s, though he was convicted in only three killings. 
3759	He was suspected of targeting Western backpackers traveling the “Hippie Trail,” an overland route that ran between Europe and Asia and attracted young adult travelers.Known as “the Serpent” for his ability to evade detection and capture by the authorities, Mr. Sobhraj has been the subject of several dramatizations, including one Netflix series . 
3760	He elevated his notoriety by fostering relationships with journalists, to whom he would tell outrageous stories about his crimes. 
3761	He was to be released from a high-security prison in Kathmandu, Nepal’s capital, on Thursday, handed over to immigration authorities and repatriated to France, his lawyer, Gopal Siwakoti, said in an interview.Mr. 
3762	Sobhraj would like to remain in Nepal for at least a week before being repatriated, Mr. Siwakoti said, to undergo a medical checkup for a heart condition and because “a few teams of documentary makers are coming from Paris.” “Being a celebrity, he has his own circle of friends,” Mr. Siwakoti added. 
3763	Mr. Sobhraj, 78, was released under a provision in Nepali law that allows older prisoners to be freed after serving 75 percent of their sentence if they have exhibited good behavior in jail or require medical treatment. 
3764	He had petitioned the court multiple times for an early release and produced documents supporting his claim that he required open-heart surgery, according to the court order. 
3765	Nepal’s Supreme Court granted his petition on medical grounds, declaring on Wednesday that keeping him behind bars was “not in line with the prisoner’s human rights,” and ordered him to be repatriated within 15 days. 
3766	Mr. Sobhraj was accused of killing tourists in Thailand, India and Nepal. 
3767	Thailand issued a warrant for his arrest in connection with the drugging and killings of six women, but he was never extradited to the country. 
3768	In 2003, Mr. Sobhraj was arrested in Nepal for the 1975 murder of Connie Jo Bronzich, an American woman. 
3769	The following year, he was convicted and given a 20-year sentence — then considered for life — that was set to expire in October 2023. 
3770	In 2014, he was convicted of the murder of Ms. Bronzich’s friend, a Canadian man named Laurent Carrière. 
3771	Mr. Sobhraj was arrested in India in 1976 for the poisoning and killing of a French tourist, Jean-Luc Solomon, and spent 20 years in the Tihar Prisons, in New Delhi. 
3772	He lived in the prison’s “luxury wing,” bribing guards with gemstones and money so that he could live apart from the other prisoners. 
3773	He also had a television, refrigerator and computer in his cell, according to the British writer Farrukh Dhondy, who maintained a decades-long relationship with Mr. Sobhraj and later wrote a book about him.Mr. 
3774	Sobhraj briefly escaped from Tihar and was recaptured shortly thereafter while dining in Goa, on the coast of western India. 
3775	Newspapers reported  at the time that he escaped the maximum-security prison by drugging his guards with a spiked birthday cake. 
3776	After his release from prison in India, he returned to France for several years. 
3777	In 2003, he visited Nepal despite an outstanding warrant for his arrest there. 
3778	He was spotted by a journalist and subsequently arrested while gambling at a casino.
3779	WASHINGTON — Like most members of Congress, Senator Susan Collins was rocked by the events of Jan. 6, 2021, as a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol and violently disrupted the ceremonial tally of presidential electoral votes. 
3780	Almost exactly a year later, Ms. Collins, Republican of Maine, happened upon an article by a prominent Republican election law expert proposing changes in the way Congress counted electoral votes, in the hopes of preventing a recurrence. 
3781	She headed into the regular private weekly party luncheon last Jan. 4 and spontaneously raised the idea of overhauling the antiquated 135-year-old law, the Electoral Count Act. 
3782	She found a ready audience among some fellow Republicans who recognized the threat. 
3783	“Our system was clearly at risk,” Ms. Collins said of the prospect that ambiguities in the archaic law could again be exploited to try to overturn a presidential election and halt the peaceful transfer of power. 
3784	There was one significant problem. 
3785	Senate Democrats had election-related goals of their own aimed at countering attempts at voter suppression in some Republican-led states. 
3786	They saw the new proposal as a subterfuge intended to sabotage their much broader legislation. 
3787	As word got out that Ms. Collins, with early encouragement from Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader and always a figure of suspicion among Democrats, was pursuing changes in the electoral count law, the Senate’s top Democrat objected sharply.
3788	“The McConnell plan, that’s what it is, is unacceptable, unacceptably insufficient and even offensive,” Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, said as he blistered the “cynical” idea on the Senate floor on the anniversary of the Jan. 6 assault. 
3789	“Score keeping matters little if the game is rigged.” 
3790	Now, another year later, Congress is poised to approve changes to the law in an effort to better secure the presidential election system that was severely tested when President Donald J. Trump and his supporters sought to exploit uncertainty in the law to hold on to power. 
3791	It took the efforts of a bipartisan group of 15 senators, months of intense negotiations, the endorsement of outside experts aligned with both parties and a stark realization that the outdated law could again be misused if changes weren’t made. 
3792	And the results the next time could be worse.
3793	“It has been lying there like unexploded ordinance since 1887,” said Bob Bauer, an election law specialist who had served as White House counsel to President Barack Obama, referring to the existing law. 
3794	“It just cried out for attention.” 
3795	It also required an acceptance by Democrats that the law needed to be strengthened even if they could not obtain much broader voter protections they were pursuing. 
3796	Democrats failed in that push because of Republican resistance and a refusal by two Democrats to eliminate the filibuster to impose the voting changes.
3797	“It finally got down to what can we do truly to address this horrific insurrection,” said Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, Ms. Collins’s initial bipartisan partner in the effort. 
3798	“How do we prevent this from ever happening again? And that’s really how we got down to the basics.” 
3799	Under the legislation, which was deemed urgent enough to be added to the huge year-end spending bill now heading toward final approval, the role of the vice president in overseeing the quadrennial counting is spelled out as strictly ceremonial. 
3800	That provision was a response to Mr. Trump’s unsuccessful effort to convince Vice President Mike Pence that the law gave him the power to reject electoral votes from some states and block or delay certification of Joseph R. Biden Jr.
3801	’s victory in the 2020 election. 
3802	The new legislation also raises the threshold for objecting to a state’s electoral votes to one-fifth of both the House and Senate. 
3803	Until now, just one House member and one senator could force the House and the Senate to consider objections, and members of both parties have raised objections over the years with little to no evidence to back them up. 
3804	The legislation also seeks to prevent competing slates of electors from being presented to Congress. 
3805	The article that spurred Ms. Collins was written by Ben Ginsberg, a well-known Republican election lawyer who served as counsel to the 2000 presidential campaign of George W. Bush and was deeply involved in the Florida recount.He argued  in National Review that Republicans and even Mr. Trump himself should want the law rewritten because the Jan. 6 assault had essentially provided a “blueprint” for future efforts to undermine an election, noting that in 2024 a Democratic vice president would be presiding over the counting of the ballots. 
3806	After opening the door to a potential rewrite, Ms. Collins immediately began meeting with a core group of senators who are typically part of bipartisan Senate efforts, including Mr. Manchin, Democrats Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona (now an independent), and Republicans Mitt Romney of Utah and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. 
3807	The group quickly expanded to include Republicans Todd Young of Indiana, Rob Portman of Ohio, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia along with Democrats Chris Coons of Delaware and Mark Warner of Virginia.As their work was proceeding behind the scenes, Democrats were pushing ahead with an ambitious plan to counter what they saw as a pervasive effort in Republican-led states to make it more difficult to vote after an expansion of vote-by-mail efforts and other pandemic-releated changes led to Democratic victories in 2020. 
3808	Democrats said the state voting law changes were aimed mainly at minorities, and President Biden infuriated Republicans when he referred to the new laws as “Jim Crow 2.0.” 
3809	The Democratic legislation encountered united Republican opposition in the Senate and died after Mr. Manchin and Ms. Sinema refused to support a change in Senate rules to gut the filibuster. 
3810	Mr. Manchin said he sought to incorporate some of the more general electoral provisions in the rewrite of the electoral count law but was rebuffed by Republicans. 
3811	Ms. Collins said the bipartisan group needed to remain focused on the electoral count or risk a shattering of the coalition.
3812	“If we got sidetracked and started re-litigating the Voting Rights Act, we would lose the Republican support, and the effort would go nowhere,” she said in an interview. 
3813	“And an opportunity to really make a difference in future presidential elections would be lost.”With Democrats unhappy about the fate of their broader bill, Ms. Shaheen encouraged Ms. Collins to add more Democrats to the group to increase chances that Democrats could ultimately be persuaded to back it. 
3814	Senators Chris Murphy of Connecticut and Ben Cardin of Maryland, both Democrats, came aboard as Ms. Collins said she realized she needed to broaden the ideological base “beyond the usual suspects.”Ms. 
3815	Shaheen said she suggested “that having them involved from the beginning in the discussion would be very helpful in persuading the rest of the Democratic caucus that this was a serious effort and we needed to do this even though we couldn’t get some of the changes people wanted.” 
3816	Members of the bipartisan group also kept in regular contact with the leaders of the Rules Committee, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the Democrat who leads the panel, and Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, its top Republican, to ease the way for the panel’s review of the legislation and avoid criticism they were operating outside of normal channels. 
3817	Ms. Collins also briefed top White House officials on the legislation to assure them it was both in good faith and a necessary effort. 
3818	And the group enlisted respected legal experts like Mr. Bauer and Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard Law School professor and a senior lawyer in the administration of George W. Bush, to advise the lawmakers and publicly back the legislation. 
3819	The Rules Committee ultimately voted 14-1 on Sept. 27 to send the legislation to the floor with just Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, objecting and Mr. McConnell voting in favor. 
3820	Even Mr. Schumer got on board despite his early skepticism.
3821	Early this month, Brad Smith, Microsoft’s president, met with Lina Khan, the chair of the Federal Trade Commission, to push for regulatory approval of Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition  of the video game company Activision Blizzard.Mr. 
3822	Smith’s gambit — which included offering to keep Activision’s blockbuster game Call of Duty widely available to satisfy competitive concerns — failed. 
3823	A day after their meeting, Ms. Khan’s agency sued to prevent the blockbuster deal .
3824	But in an interview this week, Mr. Smith was sanguine. 
3825	“She did not take me up on my offer, but when I said give peace a chance, she smiled at least a little,” he said of Ms. Khan. 
3826	“So any time somebody can end a meeting by smiling even a little, there’s always a little hope that we can sit down together in the future.” 
3827	Mr. Smith’s peacemaking comments reflect how Microsoft intends to approach the next phase of its deal for Activision. 
3828	Far from giving up on the acquisition, he said, the company intends to gamble that its “nice guy” strategy could still work. 
3829	In one plan, Microsoft hopes to win over regulators in Europe, people familiar with the approach said. 
3830	European approval of the Activision deal could force U.S. officials to reach a settlement allowing for the acquisition to move forward or for a faster, more favorable court to hear the case, the people said. 
3831	Microsoft expects to file its response to the F.T.C. lawsuit on Thursday, company officials said. 
3832	In its response, the company plans to argue that the deal would give gamers more options at lower prices, they said.The F.T.C. has said the deal should be stopped because it would harm consumers. 
3833	It said Microsoft, which makes the Xbox console , could use Call of Duty and other popular Activision titles to lure gamers from rivals, especially Sony, which makes the PlayStation console.Microsoft’s seemingly conciliatory approach is part of a nearly complete cultural transformation by the company since the 1990s, when it was known as the “Evil Empire” because of its strong-arm tactics to block out competitors. 
3834	But under Satya Nadella, who became chief executive in 2014 , and Mr. Smith, who is also Microsoft’s top lawyer, the company has bent over backward in recent years to show it has grown up.Pushing the Activision deal through has implications for more than just Microsoft. 
3835	The F.T.C. lawsuit is a landmark in a new era of government scrutiny of the biggest tech companies. 
3836	Ms. Khan has staked an aggressive trustbusting agenda on the case, which legal experts said might be difficult to win . 
3837	If Microsoft cannot get the deal approved, other tech behemoths will be less likely to be able to force a megadeal through.
3838	“They will fight it,” said Sid Parakh, a portfolio manager at Becker Capital, which invests in Microsoft. 
3839	“It’s a bit more above and beyond this deal. It’s also a statement to the F.T.C.”With Microsoft sitting on more than $100 billion to spend, he added, “they don’t want to back down now and then have every acquisition shot down.” 
3840	The acquisition of Activision must close by mid-July or Microsoft must pay as much as $3 billion in a breakup fee. 
3841	Many hurdles remain, including approval from other global regulators, notably in Britain and in the European Union. 
3842	If Microsoft can reach a formal settlement with them, it would leave the F.T.C. at a critical juncture. 
3843	The F.T.C. sued Microsoft in administrative court, which does not have the power to stop the deal from closing while the case is pending. 
3844	If other regulators approved the deal, the F.T.C. would need to decide whether to file an injunction against the acquisition in federal court to stop it. 
3845	The injunction process could move quickly, potentially handing Microsoft a swift legal victory.
3846	“There is no sensible, legitimate reason for our transaction to be prevented from closing,” the chief executive of Activision, Bobby Kotick, said in a statement on Wednesday. 
3847	“We believe we will prevail on the merits of the case.” 
3848	The F.T.C. declined to comment on Microsoft’s strategy or Mr. Smith’s conversation with Ms. Khan. 
3849	Holly Vedova, the director of the F.T.C.’s Bureau of Competition, said the agency is always willing to consider proposals from companies looking to settle antitrust concerns. 
3850	Microsoft is trying to strike a balance between, on the one hand, seeming open to a settlement and, on the other, preparing to destroy the F.T.C.’s case in court. 
3851	It has hired Beth Wilkinson, who prosecuted the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing case before becoming one of America’s premier corporate litigators, to argue on its behalf before the F.T.C. in-house court. 
3852	Mr. Smith said he was optimistic that the case could avoid a messy trial, in part because of Microsoft’s previous experiences with antitrust enforcement.In the 1990s, the company was known for its scorched-earth business tactics, bundling software products together to edge out competitors. 
3853	In 1992, as regulators investigated the company, the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates dismissed the scrutiny, saying, “The worst that could come of this is that I could fall down on the steps of the F.T.C., hit my head and kill myself.”Two years later, Microsoft agreed to a federal consent degree allowing personal computer makers more freedom to install programs from other companies. 
3854	It staved off being broken up  after a 1998 antitrust trial, and finally settled with the George W. Bush administration in 2001. 
3855	“The trial forced Microsoft to grow up, particularly in terms of its relationships with regulators and institutions beyond the tech industry,” said Margaret O’Mara, a professor at the University of Washington who researches the history of tech companies. 
3856	In 2001, Mr. Smith walked into interviews to be Microsoft’s top lawyer with a message: It was time to make peace with regulators and competitors. 
3857	He got the job. 
3858	Over the next several years, he reached legal settlements over competition concerns with governments around the world and other industry players.It was not always smooth sailing. 
3859	Negotiations between the company and Sun Microsystems, a server company that made the popular Java programming language, fell apart and took a year to get back on track. 
3860	In 2004, Steve Ballmer, Microsoft’s chief executive at the time, was on a plane to Brussels to announce a deal with the European Commission when Mr. Smith got news that the commission instead was going to sue Microsoft for pre-installing applications in its Windows operating system. 
3861	It took five years to secure a deal .
3862	Since Mr. Nadella took over, Microsoft has embraced an even more open stance. 
3863	His first acquisition was the studio that makes Minecraft, a game in which children learn and socialize in an expansive virtual world. 
3864	He also spent $7.5 billion  to buy GitHub, a software platform that supports open-source code. 
3865	Microsoft is now the world’s second-most valuable public company, largely driven by its strong cloud computing offerings. 
3866	The enterprise business at the heart of its growth generally attracts less government attention than social media or other consumer-facing ventures. 
3867	Globally, Mr. Smith has presented Microsoft as a friendly giant willing to work with skeptical lawmakers. 
3868	He has proposed middle-ground rules on contentious issues like app stores and supported bipartisan interests like the expansion of broadband. 
3869	Mr. Smith maintains powerful relationships in Washington. 
3870	A bundler for President Biden’s campaign, he attended a White House state dinner for the French president, Emmanuel Macron, just days before the F.T.C. sued to block the Activision deal.After the deal was announced in January, Microsoft went to great lengths to soothe the fears of regulators. 
3871	Mr. Smith and Mr. Nadella traveled to Washington in February to promote the deal’s benefits. 
3872	The company also made peace with an agitating labor union, which in turn lobbied the F.T.C. on the deal. 
3873	And it promised Sony that it would keep Call of Duty on PlayStation for years, and signed a deal to put the game  on Nintendo’s Switch. 
3874	Mr. Smith said that “things moved quickly” in the final weeks before Microsoft was sued. 
3875	When F.T.C. staff met with Microsoft’s team, it became clear that the agency had serious concerns, he said. 
3876	“Our team asked, ‘Could we discuss a settlement proposal?’ And the staff said, ‘Not with us,’” he said. 
3877	Later discussions with the leadership of the agency’s antitrust bureau failed to bear fruit, he added. 
3878	On Dec. 6, Microsoft drafted a formal settlement proposal for the agency. 
3879	Mr. Smith declined to say exactly what it contained but said it addressed “all the issues relating to Call of Duty,” referring to fears that Microsoft could pull the title from rival consoles. 
3880	Mr. Smith spoke to each of the agency’s four commissioners, virtually, for an hour the next day. 
3881	A day after that, the F.T.C. commissioners voted 3 to 1 to sue. 
3882	But Mr. Smith said he refused to think of the situation as an us-versus-them situation.
3883	“I will always start by asking myself, could I have done more?” he said. 
3884	“What I do know is that January brings a new year.”Kellen Browning  contributed reporting.
3885	HONG KONG — Xi Xi, whose poems and stories described with playful humor and poignancy life in the margins of Hong Kong and the city’s limbo between British and Chinese rule, died on Sunday in Hong Kong. 
3886	She was 85. 
3887	Her death, in a hospital, was announced by a writer’s collective she co-founded, Plain Leaves Workshop. 
3888	Another founder of the collective, Ho Fuk Yan, said the cause was heart failure. 
3889	A keen observer of city life, Xi Xi (pronounced SIGH-sigh in Cantonese) focused on the quiet strength of underdogs and the overlooked significance of Hong Kong itself. 
3890	Her incisive and poetic writing cemented the city’s place in Chinese-language literature and beyond.Using language that was deceptively simple, almost childlike, Xi Xi infused her fiction and poetry with eclectic references to literature, cinema, art, architecture and fairy tales. 
3891	In one of her best-known works, the novella “The Floating City ” (1986), she described Hong Kong as a vibrant city suspended in time and space as she explored the city’s pending transfer to Beijing.
3892	“The pumpkin turns into a carriage; mice turn into horses; Cinderella’s rags turn into a ball gown. But at midnight everything turns back into what it was,” she wrote. 
3893	“Was the floating city just another Cinderella?” 
3894	Decades after Hong Kong was transferred from Britain to China in 1997, she suggested that the question was far from settled.
3895	“As 1997 approached, people wrestled with the question of identity,” she said when she accepted the Newman Prize for Chinese Literature in 2019, becoming the first Hong Kong writer to win that accolade. 
3896	“Many young people are still wrestling with this question today. Don’t assume that a change in governance is an easy fix.”In nominating her for the prize, the Hong Kong poet Tammy Lai-Ming Ho described Xi Xi’s poetry as “feminine, tender, witty, observant, and capable of tugging at the heartstrings,” adding that it “speaks to the character of the city and its people.” 
3897	Xi Xi also published one of the first Chinese literary narratives about breast cancer, “Mourning a Breast,” in 1992, three years after her own diagnosis with the disease. 
3898	She said she wrote the book to support other patients and, in part, to challenge the societal taboo against speaking about illness.A former public-school teacher, she wrote poems about animals and children that were often steeped in commentary about wealth disparity and David-and-Goliath power dynamics. 
3899	In one, “Butterflies Are Lightsome Things,” heartless butterflies flutter freely as kangaroos are weighed down by the worries and concerns collected in their pouches. 
3900	In another, “The Butterfly and the Crocodile,” a butterfly defeats a crocodile by sealing its eyes shut with “soft, sweet-smelling pollen.”“She’s like the butterfly,” said Jennifer Feeley, who translated some of Xi Xi’s work, including the poetry collections “Not Written Words” (2016) and “Carnival of Animals” (2022). 
3901	“She’s really good at showing how things that people might dismiss — that seem very light, sometimes feminine, tender and whimsical — are actually very important and strong.” 
3902	Xi Xi was born Cheung Yin in Shanghai in 1937, to parents of Cantonese descent. 
3903	Her father, Cheung Lok, was a clerk at a British shipping company, Butterfield & Swire, and her mother, Luk Wah Chun, took care of the couple’s five children and their aging parents. 
3904	Xi Xi is survived by two brothers, David Cheung Yung and Cheung Yiu. 
3905	In 1950 the family moved to Hong Kong, where Mr. Cheung found work as a bus inspector. 
3906	Money was scarce, and Cheung Yin was always two days late in paying her monthly school fees. 
3907	While still a student, she began selling poems and essays to newspapers for pocket money. 
3908	She trained as a teacher at the Grantham College of Education, now part of the Education University of Hong Kong, from 1957 to 1960, and later taught Chinese, English and mathematics in primary schools for more than two decades.She wrote widely and prolifically while teaching. 
3909	She published hundreds of pieces of film criticism under different pen names and, using the pseudonym Hai Lan, wrote scripts for the Hong Kong movie studio Shaw Brothers, including a 1967 adaptation of “Little Women.” 
3910	In 1970, she adopted the pen name Xi Xi because its Chinese characters, 西西, evoked for her the motion of a girl jumping from one hopscotch square to the next. 
3911	She soon began writing the serialized novel “My City,” which zeroed in on the perspectives of working-class Hong Kong residents, as well as the neglected value of mundane items like a discarded page of poetry. 
3912	She retired from teaching in 1979 to focus on writing full time. 
3913	The next year she wrote one of the first literary pieces to refer obliquely to the looming handover of Hong Kong to China: “Glass Slippers,” a short story describing the adaptability of Hong Kong residents, including their ability to squeeze into ever-smaller apartments.In “The Floating City ,” translated into English in 1992 by Linda Jaivin with Geremie Barmé, Xi Xi questioned whether the apparent solidity of Hong Kong was chimerical, like the Surrealist painter René Magritte’s image of an apple.
3914	“The apple in the picture was not a real apple,” she wrote. 
3915	“The city that existed so miraculously might not remain stable forever. But could the floating city control its own destiny?”Her writing often emphasized the importance of the voices of children and young people, as well as the working class. 
3916	In her short story “The Case of Mary” (1986), she questioned why a child should not have a say in a battle over her custody . 
3917	She took aim at Hong Kong’s education system in a 1997 poem, “A Primary One Interview at a Band One School,” in which she wrote about a girl who gave a fake address to increase her chances of admission into first grade. 
3918	Xi Xi earned a wide following in the Chinese-speaking world after winning Taiwan’s United Daily News fiction prize in 1983 for “A Woman Like Me,” a story about a mortuary makeup artist on the cusp of revealing the full truth of her profession to a new boyfriend. 
3919	Another story, “The Cold” (1982), presented a soccer match as a reprieve to a perplexing love triangle.In “Mourning a Breast ,” she chronicled feelings of isolation and alienation from her own body, observations of how illness is portrayed in literature and art, and the frustrations of maintaining the healthful diet of a cancer patient. 
3920	She described forays into wealthy neighborhoods, where she combed supermarket shelves for groceries free of carcinogenic additives.The cancer treatment damaged a nerve in her right hand, forcing her to learn to write with her left. 
3921	She began making puppets and mohair teddy bears as a form of physical therapy, dressing them as figures from Chinese mythology, literature and history Photographs of the bears and her notes on their muses were published as “The Teddy Bear Chronicles ” in 2009.Her work inspired the opera “Women Like Us” (2020), by the composer Daniel Lo and the librettist Wong Yi, and a graphic narrative, “The Cat’s Coming (in a Left-Handed Version),” by Chihoi . 
3922	For Xi Xi, life in the city provided endless inspiration.
3923	“The Hong Kong experience is actually a treasure trove for writing,” she said at the Newman Prize ceremony. 
3924	“Because of our unique cultural context, perspective, way of thinking and manner of expression, Hong Kong writers are different from other Sinophone writers, and undeniably are a boon to the Sinophone world.”
3925	WASHINGTON — Cassidy Hutchinson, a former White House aide who was a standout witness of the House Jan. 6 committee investigation, told the panel in an interview in September that a lawyer aligned with former President Donald J. Trump had attempted to influence her testimony, the latest example of what the committee says was an effort to stonewall its inquiry. 
3926	“We just want to focus on protecting the president,” Ms. Hutchinson recalled Stefan Passantino, a former Trump White House lawyer who represented her during her early interactions with the committee, telling her.
3927	“We all know you’re loyal,” she said Mr. Passantino told her. 
3928	“Let’s just get you in and out, and this day will be easy, I promise.” 
3929	The revelation was included in transcripts of Ms. Hutchinson’s testimony the panel released on Thursday as it prepared to publish its lengthy final report into the Capitol riot and the attempt to overturn the 2020 election. 
3930	The transcripts were of closed-door interviews Ms. Hutchinson conducted with the committee after she had parted ways with Mr. Passantino, whose legal fees were being covered by allies of Mr. Trump, and hired a different lawyer.Ms. 
3931	Hutchinson would go on to provide the Jan. 6 committee with some of its most explosive testimony at a widely watched televised hearing  during which she detailed — relying at times on secondhand accounts — how Mr. Trump raged against Secret Service agents, demanded to join a crowd of his supporters at the Capitol, showed support for his supporters carrying weapons and endorsed chants of hanging his own vice president. 
3932	Ms. Hutchinson told the committee that she had been told by several allies of Mr. Trump that he knew he had lost the election two weeks after Election Day but continued to push for any way he could attempt to overturn the results, first through lawsuits but then through increasingly extreme plans.Ms. 
3933	Hutchinson testified that Mark Meadows, her boss and the White House chief of staff, spoke with her on Jan. 2, 2021, after Mr. Trump had attempted to persuade Georgia election officials  to swing the election in his favor. 
3934	“He said something to the effect of, ‘He knows it’s over. He knows he lost. But we are going to keep trying,’” 
3935	Ms. Hutchinson recalled Mr. Meadows saying, referring to Mr. Trump. 
3936	Another time, Mr. Meadows described Mr. Trump as in a constant state of fury over his election loss. 
3937	“Mark said something to the effect of, ‘He’s just so angry at me all the time. I can’t talk to him about anything post-White House without him getting mad that we didn’t win,’” she said Mr. Meadows told her. 
3938	A lawyer for Mr. Meadows did not respond to a call seeking comment. 
3939	Ms. Hutchinson also recalled John Ratcliffe, the former director of national intelligence, telling her Mr. Trump knew he lost but did not want to concede. 
3940	Mr. Passantino was not the only person who Ms. Hutchinson claimed wanted her to protect Mr. Trump. 
3941	She told the committee that on the night before her initial interview, another aide to Mr. Meadows, Ben Williamson, called her with a message.
3942	“Mark wants you to know that he knows you’re loyal and he knows you’ll do the right thing tomorrow and that you’re going to protect him and the boss,” she quoted Mr. Williamson as saying, in an apparent reference to Mr. Trump. 
3943	“You know, he knows that we’re all on the same team and we’re all a family.” 
3944	Mr. Williamson did not respond to a message seeking comment.Ms. 
3945	Hutchinson also said Mr. Passantino was working to “protect” Eric Herschmann, another lawyer for Mr. Trump, who emerged as standout of the Jan. 6 committee hearings for his colorful and profane put-downs  of the attempts to overturn the 2020 election. 
3946	In a statement through a spokesman, Mr. Herschmann disputed parts of Ms. Hutchinson’s testimony.
3947	“She told Mr. Herschmann that she was desperate, had no money and needed to find a lawyer,” the statement said. 
3948	“Mr. Herschmann never put her in contact with any lawyer. No one discussed her testimony with Mr. Herschmann, nor did anyone ever try to confirm with him whether her testimony was accurate. The only thing he ever said to her about her testimony was to be truthful.”In her two most recent interviews with the committee, Ms. Hutchinson repeatedly suggested that Mr. Passantino sought to shape her testimony and encouraged her to avoid mentioning events that might embarrass Mr. Trump. 
3949	She said she was concerned in particular about being asked about an episode in which Mr. Trump was said to have lunged at a Secret Service agent  who refused to take him to the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. 
3950	According to Ms. Hutchinson’s testimony, Mr. Passantino advised her to say that she did not recall the event if she was asked about it. 
3951	“The less you remember, the better,” she quoted him as saying. 
3952	Mr. Passantino left the White House Counsel’s Office midway through Mr. Trump’s term. 
3953	But he maintained ties to Mr. Trump’s world, including appearing in court as a lawyer for the Trump Organization regarding some of Mr. Trump’s legal matters. 
3954	His representation of Ms. Hutchinson was unorthodox from the start. 
3955	According to her testimony, she hired him without a formal engagement letter — a move he told her that she did not have to worry about. 
3956	“We have you taken care of,” she quoted him as saying.Mr. 
3957	Passantino also told Ms. Hutchinson that she would not have to pay his bills. 
3958	“We’re not telling people where funding is coming from right now,” he said by her account. 
3959	“Don’t worry, we’re taking care of you.”Ms. 
3960	Passantino this week took a leave of absence from his law firm  and defended himself against what he said were false insinuations by the panel that he had interfered with his client’s testimony.In a statement, Mr. Passantino said he “believed Ms. Hutchinson was being truthful and cooperative with the committee throughout the several interview sessions in which I represented her.”He added: “External communications made on Ms. Hutchinson’s behalf while I was her counsel were made with her express authorization. Unfortunately, the committee never reached out to me to get the facts.”In early March, on the day of her first closed-door appearance before the committee, Ms. Hutchinson said she was nervous, feeling as if “I had Trump looking over my shoulder.” 
3961	She said her anxiety grew worse when the panel asked about the episode with Mr. Trump and the Secret Service agent and, following Mr. Passantino’s advice, she said on several occasions that she did not recall it. 
3962	Seemingly in a panic, she took a break from the interview and told Mr. Passantino in a hallway that she felt as though she had lied to the committee by avoiding talking about the incident. 
3963	Mr. Passantino tried to assuage her, she testified, arguing that saying she did not recall was not the same as lying.
3964	“They don’t know what you know, Cassidy,” she quoted him as saying. 
3965	“They don’t know that you can recall some of these things.”After the interview, Ms. Hutchinson said, Mr. Passantino told her that he would help her get her “a really good job in Trump world.”“We’re going to get you taken care of,” she quoted him as saying. 
3966	“We want to keep you in the family.” 
3967	Still feeling as though she had lied to the committee, Ms. Hutchinson arranged for a friend from the White House, Alyssa Farah Griffin, Mr. Trump’s former director of strategic communications, to quietly reach out to the panel and have her return for another interview to explore the incident involving Mr. Trump and the Secret Service. 
3968	After that interview, Ms. Hutchinson said, Mr. Passantino, who still represented her at that point, was stunned that investigators knew about the episode. 
3969	He later related what had happened during the interview to Mr. Meadows’s lawyers even though Ms. Hutchinson had asked him not to. 
3970	The committee has so far released transcripts of more than 35 of its hundreds of witness interviews. 
3971	The transcripts are also going to the Justice Department, which has been pursuing a criminal investigation into the efforts to keep Mr. Trump in power despite his election loss.
3972	STRASBOURG, France — The noon church bell had just chimed on Strasbourg’s vast Christmas market, briefly drowning out the sound of carols from speakers, and Franck Bodein was enveloped in fumes from a giant skillet of frying mushrooms. 
3973	Steaming pots of mulled wine and pans overflowing with a gooey casserole known as tartiflette lined his stall, just as they have for the two decades he has been working at the market. 
3974	One key feature, however, was conspicuously absent this year: the Christmas lights.
3975	“They’re gone,” Mr. Bodein said, pointing a wooden spoon at nearby plane trees whose branches used to be festooned with garlands of lights. 
3976	“It’s too bad. They brought the fairy tale atmosphere.”Strasbourg’s Christmas market — the Christkindelsmärik, or “Christ child market” in the local dialect — is France’s oldest and largest. 
3977	It has grown from a few stalls of herbalists and gingerbread vendors near the cathedral in the 16th century into a citywide extravaganza, offering everything from roasted chestnuts to jewelry. 
3978	The city has proclaimed itself the “Capital of Christmas.” 
3979	The market is a monthlong excuse to socialize and shop amid wooden chalets offering traditional food and drinks. 
3980	But its main attraction, luring nearly two million visitors each year, has always been the Christmas lights.But as Europe has embarked on an enormous energy saving effort  to get through a winter without Russian gas, the continent’s energy-hungry Christmas markets, a seasonal feature across Europe, have been a prime target and forced difficult debates about just how much seasonal glow cities can afford or should indulge in. 
3981	Illuminations have been scaled back, seasonal ice rinks canceled and outdoor heaters banned.Across France, many cities have struggled to keep the year-end festive spirit while addressing rising energy prices. 
3982	Fears of blackouts have forced local authorities to look for cuts at the risk of spoiling a Christmas season that is often intended to cheer people up, especially after months of economic crisis marked by strikes and soaring costs of living . 
3983	“The question is, how do you balance magic and responsibility?” said Guillaume Libsig, a Strasbourg deputy mayor in charge of city events. 
3984	Every December, a dozen squares in the center of Strasbourg, a city of nearly 300,000 residents bordering Germany, are taken over by more than 300 stalls, in a vibrant atmosphere where the pungent smell of sauerkraut meets the vanilla-scented aroma of baking waffles. 
3985	And even this year, the market is not without a seasonal gleam. 
3986	Some 30 miles of lighting displays are still deployed around Strasbourg, with garlands and chandeliers bathing streets in a pink, blue and golden glow. 
3987	Installations include glittering gingerbread men with candy canes and twinkling angels hanging over a street leading to the city’s cathedral. 
3988	From the top of the religious edifice, for at least a few hours at night, Strasbourg shimmers like the sun on the sea. 
3989	“Dazzling,” Gabrielle Carl, a local resident, said on a recent evening.
3990	“Well,” she added, “energy-guzzling too.” 
3991	Several years ago, Strasbourg’s Christmas market switched to LED lights, which use up to 90 percent less electricity than traditional incandescent bulbs. 
3992	But the lighting budget still adds up to hundreds of thousands of euros, and Mr. Libsig acknowledged that the event represented an energy burden that had long been overlooked. 
3993	“We used to push the button, there was light, and nobody was wondering where it came from,” he said. 
3994	Then came the Ukraine war.Faced with soaring gas and electric costs as a result of Russia’s invasion, France launched a sweeping plan of “energy sobriety” to cut energy consumption by 10 percent in two years, including lowering heating in buildings and scaling back lighting. 
3995	Private companies and public administrations have been required to join the effort . 
3996	In Strasbourg that meant targeting the Christkindelsmärik, long considered untouchable. 
3997	In the fall, the local authorities announced they would reduce city-run illuminations by one-fifth; turn off lights an hour earlier at night; and wrap up the light show a week earlier. 
3998	The goal was to reduce energy consumption by 10 percent compared to last year. 
3999	Some areas, such as the one where Mr. Bodein was cooking mushrooms, have been deprived of Christmas lights as a result. 
4000	And people exiting restaurants after a late meal are now plunged into the darkness of some of Strasbourg’s cobbled streets. 
4001	But many visiting the market said they were satisfied with the changes, noting that the festive spirit had been maintained overall.
4002	“A few cuts won’t hurt,” said Leonor Lorents. 
4003	She added that restrictions should only go so far because “it’s important to keep these big events that get people together.”Still, Ms. Lorents and others said the Christmas market was suffering the consequences of what they considered the government’s failure to secure enough energy supplies  to replace Russian gas.The resentment was especially high among vendors, no longer allowed to use heaters  to keep warm in their open-air chalets. 
4004	On a recent subfreezing evening, they were bundled up in parkas and mittens, as if going skiing. 
4005	They stared jealously at the mulled wine sellers basking in the hot fumes emanating from large copper pots. 
4006	“It’s a bit radical. Couldn’t we save up elsewhere?” 
4007	Jacqueline Jacquetton grumbled behind her stall, where she sold soaps and fabrics. 
4008	She confessed she had kept a small heater hidden under her counter. 
4009	“I’m not going to put my health at risk,” she said.Alexis Chaun, who worked at one of Mr. Bodein’s stalls, said the changes had made the market “less joyful.”Several towns near Strasbourg have gone further in their cuts or proved more innovative in dealing with rising energy costs. 
4010	Haguenau got rid of its skating rink, an energy-hungry attraction that environmentalist have criticized for years . 
4011	Colmar and Illkirch-Graffenstaden have installed solar panels to power lighting displays and a Ferris wheel.Pierre Muller, the head of Eco-Manifestations Alsace, an organization that assesses the environmental footprint of events, praised Strasbourg’s efforts. 
4012	But he noted that most of the market’s energy consumption came from visitors traveling there. 
4013	Reducing lighting, he said, “only has a marginal impact.”“One way,” he added, to really cut the energy burden would be “to reduce the number of visitors.” 
4014	This may prove too radical a step for Strasbourg’s cherished, and profitable, market.Gwenn Bauer, the head Les Vitrines de Strasbourg, an organization representing the city’s retail businesses, said he did not want “a lugubrious Christmas.” 
4015	Driven by the energy crisis, his organization has tested solar-powered lamps on a small street. 
4016	But it has stopped short of scaling back the number of Christmas lights it installed this year, some 12 miles. 
4017	“It must remain magical,” Mr. Bauer said.Mr. 
4018	Libsig, the deputy mayor, seemed more open to considering greater efforts, especially as French cities try to become more climate-friendly in the face of rising temperatures and air pollution .
4019	Referring to the “Christmas of our grandparents,” when a family gathering by the fire was enough to make one happy, he said the market must “regain some authenticity” and no longer be synonymous with “carelessness and the logic of overconsumption.”“The DNA of Christmas is totally compatible with this notion of responsibility and the end of abundance,” Mr. Libsig said. 
4020	“In fact, Christmas can be an example of how to initiate changes.”
4021	He never donned the political camouflage of a suit.The olive green sweatshirt, with its little Ukrainian trident embroidered at the neck, cargo pants and boots that President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine wore on his trip to Washington  may seem the least important part of the highly choreographed and powerful piece of political theater that was that diplomatic event, but they were also a telling detail: a reminder of what exactly the purpose of the surprise visit had been. 
4022	Namely, that despite the fact that it was Mr. Zelensky’s first foreign trip since the Russian invasion of Ukraine began, and despite the fact that Ukraine has defied all odds in holding out for 10 months against an aggressor that was widely expected to roll over the country with ease, the watching world should be on notice: The fight was far from over. 
4023	In his wartime uniform, Mr. Zelensky was a constant, living symbol of that battle, no matter the pomp and circumstance that surrounded him. 
4024	His D.I.Y. fatigues stood out from the moment he emerged from his diplomatic vehicle on the White House lawn to be greeted by President Biden and the first lady, Jill Biden. 
4025	They were a stark contrast to the president’s classic navy suit and the first lady’s sky blue coatdress and pumps. 
4026	They stood out when Mr. Zelensky posed with the president for a photo call in the Oval Office, just in front of a fireplace festooned with Christmas wreaths, and in the joint news conference the two men held afterward, the flags of the United States and Ukraine at their backs. 
4027	And they especially stood out in the grand, wood-paneled halls of the Capitol building, where Mr. Zelensky took to the podium to address a joint session of Congress, looking out at a sea of dark suits, occasionally lightened by lawmakers wearing jackets and accessories in the blue and yellow of Ukraine.
4028	“As far as we know, no one’s ever addressed the United States Congress in a sweatshirt before,” Tucker Carlson scoffed later on his Fox News show, comparing Mr. Zelensky to “the manager of a strip club” as well as to Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced cryptocurrency financier. 
4029	(The idea was, perhaps, to suggest that both men eschewed a suit and used people’s money for their own purposes — though that seems a bit of a stretch, since one has been indicted on charges of fraud and the other is fighting for his country.) 
4030	Mr. Carlson may have been right about it being a first for the sweatshirt and Congress, but he missed the symbolism behind the choice. 
4031	And there’s no question it was a choice aforethought.There was enough time, after all, during his journey overseas, even given its clandestine nature, for Mr. Zelensky to change clothes if he had wanted. 
4032	And he clearly understands the power of optics. 
4033	Not just because of his background as an actor, but because of the consistency with which he has played his part in public speeches, addressing his people and his allies via video message from a bunker in Kyiv, Ukraine, most often in an olive green tee , connecting himself to the men on the ground, giving a human face to the fight. 
4034	Military garb comes with its own hierarchy and associations. 
4035	That Mr. Zelensky has chosen the most basic, democratic garments of all to make his own is not an accident. 
4036	And that he chose to remain in character for Congress was as much a strategic decision as any deployment, this one targeted to an image-consuming age. 
4037	To say that he understands part of his job is marketing and branding is not to dismiss his appearance as merely performative, but to acknowledge that he is using every tool at his disposal in service of his goal.As it happens, Speaker Nancy Pelosi had made her own comparisons regarding Mr. Zelensky’s trip, likening it to Winston Churchill’s 1941 address to Congress , also in December, also in wartime. 
4038	(The Churchill comparison was a popular one.) 
4039	But while Mr. Churchill had arrived at the White House with his own symbolic accessories — wearing a naval cap, carrying a walking stick topped by a flashlight as a relic of London’s blackouts — he spoke to Congress in the traditional, stately familiarity of a suit, appealing to the like-minded by looking like-minded. 
4040	Mr. Zelensky took a different tack, understanding that he would have painted a different picture of his circumstances had he changed his style, suggesting perhaps that the war had also changed. 
4041	Instead, he stayed his course. 
4042	When, at the end of his speech, Mr. Zelensky handed a Ukrainian flag signed by soldiers fighting on the Donbas front to Ms. Pelosi and Vice President Kamala Harris, and they unfurled it behind his olive green silhouette like a frame, it was the picture of the evening. 
4043	Odds are, when history is written, it will be the image that remains. 
4044	It was impossible not to read in that visual the point the Ukrainian president also made in words: that he was there not as a sovereign leader making nice with a global peer, but as a sovereign leader turned soldier, to reiterate not just to those in the room but to all possible audiences (the people watching at home, skimming the internet, sitting in the Kremlin), that he and the country he represents were fighting not just for themselves, but for the values the Western world holds dear. 
4045	That they were fighting for everyone, and that it was a fight as much for minds as for land. 
4046	The sweatshirt said it all.

4048	Good evening. 
4049	Here’s the latest at the end of Wednesday. 
4050	1. In a visit to the U.S., President Volodymyr Zelensky met with President Biden.Ukraine’s president arrived in Washington this afternoon, where tonight he plans to address a joint session of Congress in a bid to rally support for his country’s war effort. 
4051	Before the speech, Zelensky — making his first trip outside Ukraine since Russia invaded in February — met at the White House with Biden, who pledged support for “the great people of Ukraine.”As the Ukrainian leader arrived, Antony Blinken, the secretary of state, announced that the U.S. was sending Ukraine another $1.8 billion in military aid, including a Patriot missile battery , one of its most advanced air defense systems.In Ukraine, as the war approaches its second year, Ukrainian troops will find it more challenging to reclaim territory  from Russian forces who are focused on defending their remaining land gains rather than making a deeper push into the country, American officials said.In other politics news, Benjamin Netanyahu announced that he had formed a government in Israel that will bring him back at the helm of a hard-right coalition 
4052	. 
4053	2. The I.R.S. delayed auditing Donald Trump, despite a mandate.The tax agency failed to audit Trump during his first two years in office  despite a program that makes the auditing of sitting presidents mandatory, and only began in 2019. 
4054	The delay was revealed last night when a House committee voted to make public six years of the former president’s tax documents.The documents released by the House showed that Trump paid $1.1 million in federal income taxes in his first three years as president, and paid no taxes in 2020 as his income began to dwindle. 
4055	Here’s a year-to-year breakdown .
4056	In other tax news, some users of Venmo, Etsy, CashApp and other e-commerce platforms must start reporting small transactions,  sowing fears among small-business owners. 
4057	3. Elon Musk’s distraction is just one of Tesla’s problems.Issues at Tesla, the world’s most valuable car company, are puncturing its mystique as the clear leader in electric vehicles . 
4058	It has struggled to ramp up production at new factories; Covid restrictions and dysfunctional supply chains have caused intermittent shutdowns at its Shanghai factory; and amid global recession concerns, demand for Tesla vehicles appears to be slackening.Yet Musk has been preoccupied with Twitter. 
4059	Yesterday, he said he would resign as chief executive “as soon as I find someone foolish enough to take the job,” but many question whether he will really step away .
4060	In related news, many companies are eager to recycle electric-car batteries, but there aren’t enough available .4. 
4061	The nation’s midsection is preparing for a “bomb cyclone.”Just as holiday travel reaches its peak by the end of this week, an intensifying storm system and a large Arctic air mass will bring blizzard conditions and extremely dangerous wind chills — down to 70 below zero in some places — to the Plains and Midwest. 
4062	The East also faces a flash freeze and high winds that could disrupt travel. 
4063	The National Weather Service said that Buffalo could face a “once-in-a-generation storm.”The storm, which is expected to sweep across large swaths of the country between today and Friday, will also mean that thousands of Americans who are counted on to work through this week could face potentially dangerous conditions on the job .
4064	If you’re still planning to travel, be prepared for chaos at the airports  and additional traffic on major roads. 
4065	5. 
4066	Even seniors are skipping the latest Covid booster. 
4067	As the pandemic barrels into its third winter, and Covid hospitalizations and deaths begin to climb once again, medical experts worry that there is no effective plan to update the immunizations of the most vulnerable Americans . 
4068	Only 36 percent of Americans 65 and older have received the updated Covid vaccine, known as the bivalent booster, compared with 94 percent of the same group who had their initial shots. 
4069	Their diminishing immunity has largely transformed the pandemic from a threat against the unvaccinated to one against older adults, many of whom were once well protected.In other health news, we asked experts for steps to manage holiday loneliness .6. 
4070	For Google, a new A.I. chat bot is a “code red.”When ChatGPT was rolled out to the public this month, many users were awed by its uncanny ability to write, answer or code nearly anything you ask it to. 
4071	But Google managers saw the tool as an existential threat to their search dominance. 
4072	One executive described the situation as make or break for the company’s future . 
4073	Google is well positioned to release a competing chat bot of its own: Its own developers built the tech at the heart of ChatGPT. 
4074	Yet they may be reluctant to do so because it is not well suited to deliver digital ads, which accounted for more than 80 percent of Google’s revenue last year.A related tip: Our Tech Fix columnist explains how to use ChatGPT without causing harm to ourselves or others 
4075	. 
4076	7. Jenna Bush Hager is making a book list.  
4077	Authors are obsessed with it.When Hager features a book on the “Today” show, it will very likely become a best seller. 
4078	It might well become a television series, produced by Jenna Bush Hager, whom the viewing public has come to trust like an insistently persuasive aunt . 
4079	Since 2019, books in her “Read With Jenna” book club have outpaced the overall adult fiction market by almost 60 percent. 
4080	The result is a heady inversion: Once known for her last name, Hager has become as famous for her first, across the signature purple sticker that novelists plot to slap onto their book covers.  
4081	8. The Mets just keep spending money.In a surprising turn of events, Carlos Correa, a star shortstop, walked away from a $350 million contract agreement with the San Francisco Giants and is now set to sign a 12-year, $315 million deal with the Mets. 
4082	It would be the latest in a series of expensive signings  since the team was purchased by the billionaire Steven Cohen.The Mets’ payroll will be around $380 million — far and away breaking the M.L.B. record. 
4083	And because of enhanced luxury tax penalties that were nicknamed the “Cohen Tax,”  the team will most likely owe another $110 million, putting its total outlay for next year at nearly $500 million.In other sports news, Franco Harris, the Hall of Fame running back for the Pittsburgh Steelers who caught the “Immaculate Reception,” died at 72 
4084	. 
4085	9. Onstage, it’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas again.After two years of Christmastime washouts — when theater turned digital in 2020, and when Omicron paused many productions last winter — performance institutions say they are determined that this year holiday shows will be back in full force . 
4086	For arts lovers and arts presenters, late December has long loomed large. 
4087	“The Nutcracker,” “A Christmas Carol” and “Messiah” are cherished holiday traditions, and on Broadway, year-end is when houses are fullest.In other seasonal news, Dolly Parton’s theme park has transformed, over three decades, into a major Christmas attraction .10. 
4088	And finally,  today is the winter solstice. 
4089	You might not be here without it. 
4090	For those of us in the Northern Hemisphere, the sun hardly stuck around today. 
4091	In New York, for example, the nine hours of sunlight are the fewest of any day of the year.While many may respond to the darkness with despair, the tilt of the Earth that causes the changing seasons may also have allowed for life to exist here . 
4092	Other planets, such as Uranus, have much more extreme tilts, where no region could be continuously habitable by humans. 
4093	Have an extended night.
