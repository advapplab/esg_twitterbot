3	"This is the time of year to look back and to look ahead.This essay focuses on looking back at my predictions for 2022, published in the Jan. 7 Liquid Assets column, ""The year ahead for water: The Roaring '20s and creative destruction."" "
4	I believe I was mostly right. 
5	"(Feel free to challenge this when I post to GreenBiz and LinkedIn!)  The theme for that article was that we are in the Roaring '20s for innovation and witnessing the ""creative destruction"" of how we extract water, transport it and treat it. "
6	I proposed that technology innovation would be a primary driver for creative destruction of existing business models, as the global economy emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
7	First a recap about the concept of creative destruction. 
8	"As I mentioned last year, in the early 20th century, economist Joseph Schumpeter described the dynamic pattern in which innovative entrepreneurs unseat established firms through a process he called ""creative destruction."" "
9	"According to Schumpeter, and discussed in detail in ""The Prophet of Innovation: Joseph Schumpeter and Creative Destruction,"" the entrepreneur not only creates invention but also creates competition from a new commodity, new technology, new source of supply and a new type of organization. "
10	"This innovation propels the economy with ""gales of creative destruction,"" which ""incessantly revolutionizes the economic structure from within, incessantly destroying the old one, incessantly creating a new one.""My overarching view of 2022: Cracks are beginning to show, primarily the result of chronic problems that have long plagued the water sector — aging infrastructure, underfunding and grossly outdated public policies. "
11	These systemic failures in the water sector in many cases were amplified by the impacts of climate .  
12	"These systemic failures in the water sector and climate change led to the ""bite"" —creative destruction in play — that water challenges posed to economic development, business growth, ecosystems and civil society in 2022. "
13	That bite manifested itself in climate-induced events such as the aridification of the American West, which is resulting in the demise of the Colorado River Basin and the potential threat to hydropower production; the disruption of river commerce in the major rivers such as the Mississippi in the U.S., and the Danube, the Rhine and the Po in Europe; along with the catastrophic flooding  in Pakistan. 
14	All of these events had and continue to have quantifiable economic impacts on local and national economies as covered in these news stories. 
15	Other significant factors contributed to the disruption, including: What do these trends mean for 2023? 
16	My January prediction: Water technology innovation scales and becomes the catalyst to drastically change public policy.  
17	More to follow.

20	Mary Yap has always been a stargazer. 
21	As a child growing up in the Seattle area, she would regularly sneak out of her room late at night, plant herself on the bathroom floor and stare up at the stars through the skylight, filled with wonder.Her contemplative nature, along with an urgent desire to make change, eventually led Yap to entrepreneurship. 
22	Earlier this year, she cofounded Lithos Carbon , along with two Earth Sciences professors. 
23	The startup works with farmers to permanently remove CO2 from the atmosphere and enhance crop yields by spreading basalt dust — waste created when quarries crush basalt rock for other uses — onto farmlands.Lithos — the Greek word for stone — uses proprietary software to custom-deploy the basalt based on variables such as soil chemistry and crop nutrition. 
24	It also measures how much CO2 is removed and sells carbon credits to companies, providing a share of the payment to the farmers it works with. 
25	Lithos, which says it has captured more than 2,000 tons of carbon in 2022, is selling the credits through Frontier , a $1 billion advance market commitment led by Stripe, Alphabet, Shopify, Meta and McKinsey.Based on a natural process called rock weathering, Lithos’ technology was invented by Yap’s cofounders, Noah Planavsky, associate professor of Earth and Planetary Sciences (and her mentor) at Yale, and Chris Reinhard, associate professor of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Tech. 
26	The startup’s use of science and technology to create a cost-effective and scalable climate solution quickly caught the attention of investors. 
27	Just two months after launching in March, Lithos announced a $6.29 million round of seed funding , from a group of investors that included Union Square Ventures, Greylock Partners and Bain Capital Ventures.As the granddaughter of an entrepreneur and descendant of Taiwanese farmers, founding an agriculture-based climate startup might seem like an obvious career choice for Yap, 30, but her path to entrepreneurship was anything but a straight trajectory. 
28	At 18, she abandoned plans to become a doctor to head to Silicon Valley, where she spent six years scaling other people’s companies, including social payments startup Tilt, acquired by Airbnb. 
29	Following the unexpected deaths of two close friends, she took a year to travel and soul search, which ultimately led her to pursue sustainable architecture. 
30	She got into Yale through the Eli Whitney Students Program , designed for students who’ve taken a nontraditional path to college, and majored in urban studies. 
31	She later added a second major, earth and planetary sciences, which led to lab work with Planavsky and eventually to Lithos. 
32	I recently spoke to Yap about her young startup, life as an entrepreneur, the path she took to get there, and what inspires her. 
33	The conversation has been edited for clarity and length.CJ Clouse: Can you walk me through Lithos’ process and how the technology works? 
34	First, where does the basalt come from? 
35	Mary Yap:  Basalt is a volcanic rock. 
36	If you think about Iceland or Hawaii, basalt is the black rock those places are made of, but it can be found all around the world. 
37	It’s mined regularly for use in concrete, asphalt, construction … and there's rock dust that’s created during that process, which has no commercial value. 
38	The waste dust is what we’re upcycling.Clouse: How do you convince farmers to use your technology? 
39	Do you sell it as an income stream from the sale of carbon credits? 
40	Yap:  We do give them a carbon credit kickback. 
41	We want to be very generous there. 
42	But I don't focus on the carbon capture part when I first talk to a farmer. 
43	Usually, they're more excited about this because we replace the limestone they’re using to de-acidify their soil and restore nutrients with something that can do a better job. 
44	We’re able to give them [customized] rock dust that has the specific nutrients necessary to restore the soil, and it can improve their crop yields, up to 40 percent in some cases. 
45	And because we’re able to completely replace the limestone they’d otherwise be using, that’s a cost savings for them out of the gate.Clouse: So they sprinkle the basalt on the crops, and it helps the soil capture more carbon? 
46	What happens to the basalt in the end?
47	Yap:  One key thing to know about our process is that it’s different from storing organic soil carbon, where you're trying to keep carbon in the ground. 
48	What we do is create dissolved inorganic carbon or bicarbonate. 
49	When it rains, the basalt reacts with the rainwater, converting carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into dissolved bicarbonate. 
50	The bicarbonate then washes off in the rivers and groundwaters and ends up in the ocean, where it eventually sinks to the bottom, the deep ocean, where it’s trapped and locked away permanently.Clouse: How many farms are you working with now? 
51	And where are they? 
52	Yap:  We primarily operate in the Midwest and parts of the East Coast today. 
53	We're working with over 1,000 acres right now, about 14 farms, but we’re scaling up. 
54	We've got a long wait list of farmers.Clouse: You were able to secure a round of seed funding quite early on. 
55	Did having contacts from your former life in Silicon Valley help with that?
56	Yap:  A little bit, but this is a different space than what I was in before, which was consumer software. 
57	I do know folks out here in the valley, and it was helpful to get advice from other founders and investors. 
58	A climate tech company is a hard tech company, and sometimes those can be harder to fund. 
59	And beyond that, there's no playbook for success. 
60	There's no playbook for deploying a bunch of rock dust to farmers, who use it to capture carbon from the atmosphere.Clouse: Has anything about the experience launching your own company surprised you? 
61	Has anything been easier or harder than you expected?
62	Yap:  Honestly, the trucking logistics was pretty hard. 
63	Finding the right kind of trucks to move all this material around and getting those trucks to the quarries. 
64	Figuring out the scheduling for all of that and getting things delivered on time. 
65	I spent many mornings calling a bunch of truckers, and that wasn’t exactly what I’d originally envisioned. 
66	Plus, I don’t have any experience with trucks. 
67	I had little toy trucks when I was a kid, but that's about it.Clouse: That’s as good a segue as any to the next question: What kind of kid were you? 
68	What was your childhood like? 
69	And your family? 
70	Yap:  My mother immigrated to the U.S. from Taiwan, where she’d grown up on farm in the highlands. 
71	My father grew up in Malaysia. 
72	So my whole family is in Southeast Asia; it’s really just my mom, my little sister and me here in the States. 
73	My mom and dad divorced when I was 7, and he moved back to Malaysia. 
74	Growing up in Seattle, I spent a lot of my childhood out in nature, literally staring at plants, wondering how they grow, staring at spiderwebs, all of those kinds of things. 
75	We didn't have a TV, and I didn't get a phone until I came to San Francisco when I was 18, so you just kind of learn from the world around you. 
76	I also read a lot of books about astronomy, actually. 
77	I'm obsessed with the stars, with the idea of space and how we are so small in the universe. 
78	The first thing I ever wanted to be was an astronaut. 
79	The second was a marine biologist. 
80	I'm also obsessed with the ocean. 
81	Clouse: When you were working in the startup world, something happened that changed your life. 
82	Two of your friends passed away. 
83	Can you tell me a little bit about that? 
84	And I'm sorry, that must have been horrible.Yap:  It was a rough year. 
85	I had helped launch a couple of startups, and everything was going well. 
86	I loved what I did, I loved the team I was leading. 
87	But in 2016, I got a call at work — one of my best friends had been on a trip with her parents, she got hit by a logging truck and died on the spot. 
88	She was the same age as me, 24, and had so much potential. 
89	Then I lost another friend a couple months after that, in another accident. 
90	Sometimes these horrible, tragic things bring you a sense of clarity — survival is not guaranteed for us as individuals or as a society. 
91	I suddenly realized I don't know how long I have here; I could get hit by a bus in two years. 
92	So I want to be working on the most important problem, and that was not consumer software, no matter how much I liked it.Clouse: So you took a year off to do some traveling, some soul searching. 
93	What did this lead to? 
94	Yap:  I actually met with a bunch of farmers when I was in Indonesia, who were having problems growing rice. 
95	I thought, the climate crisis, urgency, we need to do something. 
96	That’s it. 
97	And my father happens to be an architect and I'd heard a lot from him about the work he does. 
98	So I went back to school. 
99	I was trying to take a data-driven, technical approach to decarbonizing cities. 
100	I wanted to build more cost efficient, more environmentally efficient buildings that use less energy.Clouse: And how did you get from architecture and greening cities to farms and carbon capture? 
101	Yap:  After my first year at Yale, I got a fellowship that paid for me travel abroad [again], for the summer, and shadow urban planners and architects in 11 different countries, in Scandinavia and Southeast Asia. 
102	I saw how they were building new cities from scratch, and I was a little disappointed. 
103	There was so much greenwashing in the field. 
104	For example, there’s a city in Malaysia, built on this artificial island where there used to be a bed of seagrass. 
105	And now the nurseries have crashed, and the fishermen aren’t able to catch fish. 
106	This is the opposite of sustainability.When I came back to Yale, I thought, we need to take a science-driven approach to this. 
107	I ended up going deep into the science of carbon cycling. 
108	I took classes in fossil fuels, renewable energy, oceanography… And three of my classes ended up being taught by Noah Planavsky. 
109	He and Chris [Reinhard] had been researching something called rock weathering, which the Earth has been doing for 4.5 billion years. 
110	This process removes carbon from the atmosphere to the tune of about 1 billion tons every year. 
111	It's massive. 
112	Without it, our planet would look like Venus, covered with greenhouse gases. 
113	I thought, if the Earth is so good at this, is there some way we can manipulate this process, speed it up, and actually make this a carbon removal technology? 
114	Clouse: I was curious about your grandmother being an entrepreneur. 
115	Did you learn anything from her or take any inspiration from her? 
116	Is she still living?
117	Yap:  Yes, she is. 
118	She is 96 and still so sharp. 
119	She grew up as a farmer and married a fisherman, and she was a secret entrepreneur before women could be entrepreneurs. 
120	In the 1940s, she started what was essentially a fertilizer business. 
121	She realized that a lot of families who had pigs just left manure lying on the ground. 
122	Early in the morning, when it was still dark, she would go collect pig manure that nobody was using, and turn that into fertilizer, then take it to another part of the island and sell it to other farmers. 
123	I only connected the dots after we started the company, and I thought, wait, my grandma built a circular economy in farming! 
124	So I am really inspired by her.Clouse: Are you still inspired by the stars? 
125	Still a stargazer? 
126	Yap:  For sure. 
127	Sometimes, when I'm feeling stressed, I’ll go out and sleep on the roof or somewhere, because it’s stuffy inside, and I just need to be outside. 
128	It's good to look at the stars. 
129	You can't see quite as many of them in San Francisco, but they're still there.
130	India is planning a $2 billion incentive programme for the green hydrogen industry, three sources told Reuters, in a bid to cut emissions and become a major export player in the field. 
131	The 180-billion-rupee ($2.2 billion) incentive aims to reduce the production cost of green hydrogen by a fifth over the next five years, said a senior government official and an industry manager working in renewable energy. 
132	It would do this in part by increasing the scale of the industry, they said. 
133	The current cost in India is 300 rupees to 400 rupees per kg, said the manager. 
134	The United States and the European Union have already approved incentives worth billions of dollars for green hydrogen projects. 
135	Hydrogen can be used as a fuel. 
136	It is made by splitting water with an electrical process, electrolysis. 
137	If the devices that do that, electrolysers, are powered by renewable energy, the product is called green hydrogen, a fuel free of greenhouse emissions. 
138	The Indian aid could be announced in the Feb. 1 budget for the fiscal year beginning April 1, said the government official. 
139	All sources declined to be named discussing a budget proposal. 
140	The ministries of renewable energy and finance did not respond to queries sent by Reuters. 
141	Indian companies such as Reliance Industries, Indian Oil, NTPC, Adani Enterprises, JSW Energy and Acme Solar have big plans on green hydrogen. 
142	Adani, led by the world’s third-richest person, Gautam Adani, said in June that it and France’s TotalEnergies would jointly create the “world’s largest green hydrogen ecosystem”.
143	See related article: India Publishes Long Term Emissions Strategy to Reach Net Zero in 2070 The Indian government expects industry to invest 8 trillion rupees in green hydrogen and its derivative green ammonia by 2030, said the industry manager and another government official. 
144	Green ammonia is made by combining nitrogen with hydrogen using renewable energy sources; it can be used by the fertiliser industry or as a fuel or convenient means of transporting hydrogen. 
145	The green hydrogen proposal is likely to be called “Strategic Intervention for Green Hydrogen Transition (SIGHT)” and will be split into 45 billion rupees for electrolyser manufacturing for five years and the 135 billion rupees for green hydrogen and green ammonia production for three years, the manager and second official said. 
146	The incentive for making green hydrogen is likely to be 50 rupees per kg for three years, they said. 
147	India aims to sell 70% of the production to countries such as South Korea, Japan and in the European Union, an industry official said, adding that derivatives, including green ammonia, had an equally strong demand. 
148	The government is estimating global demand for green hydrogen will exceed 100 million tonnes by 2030, from just under 75 million tonnes now, according to other industry sources. 
149	In February the government announced plans for India to make 5 million tonnes of green hydrogen annually by 2030, a figure that the first government official said could be doubled, depending on international demand. 
150	The government also plans for the country to achieve electrolyser manufacturing capacity of 15 gigawatts in phases by 2030. 
151	That would be almost 10 times current global capacity. 
152	U.S.-based Ohmium International has commissioned India’s first green-hydrogen factory in Bengaluru. 
153	Reliance Industries, Larsen & Toubro, Greenko and H2e Power last year announced plans to build gigawatt-scale factories. 
154	Indian oil refineries and fertiliser and steel plants annually use 5 million tonnes of hydrogen made from natural gas, called grey hydrogen. 
155	The process produces carbon dioxide. 
156	Higher gas prices have pushed the Indian grey hydrogen price to around 200 rupees per kg from 130 rupees a year ago.Source: Reuters
157	The building blocks of the European Health Union are officially in place. 
158	This not only includes stronger EU rules on serious cross-border threats to health, but also a stronger mandate of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and a new Emergency Framework for medical countermeasures. 
159	Taken together with an extended mandate of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the establishment of the Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA), the EU now has the tools necessary to prepare for and better respond in the event of a public health emergency. 
160	The entry into force of these new rules completes the preparedness and response capacities of the European Health Union, creating a robust legal framework to improve the EU’s capacity in the vital areas of prevention, preparedness, surveillance, risk assessment, early warning, and response.The Serious cross-border threats to health Regulation now gives the EU:A stronger ECDC is now able not only issue recommendations to Member States regarding health threats preparedness , but also host a new excellence network of EU reference laboratories and establish an EU Health Task Force for rapid health interventions in the event of a major outbreak.See related article: EU Approves 28 Billion Euro German Renewable Energy SchemeTo be effective and operational in times of public health emergencies, the Emergency Framework Regulation now allows the establishment within HERA of a Health Crisis Board . 
161	This Board will rapidly coordinate at EU level the supply of and access to medical countermeasures. 
162	The Regulation also enables the activation of the EU fab facilities, emergency research and innovation plans and access to emergency funding. 
163	Two years after we put forward our vision for a strong European Health Union, today it becomes a reality. 
164	COVID showed what we can achieve when we work together as a Union, and now we have the tools necessary to chart a new course for EU health preparedness and response. 
165	Rapid and decisive action as a Union is our strongest tool to protect our citizens from health threats, and we need strong and permanent mechanisms to do so. 
166	I would like to thank our Member States and the European Parliament for their cooperation and support throughout this process. 
167	This is a positive way to finish the year 2022 for our citizens for the European Health Union. 
168	I am pleased to see, once again, that collective work pays off. 
169	This is an important achievement that proofs that European public health has been and remains a priority in our policy making.
