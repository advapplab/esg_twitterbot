0	By Eric Lipton, Michael Crowley and John IsmayWASHINGTON — The prospect of growing military threats from both China and Russia is driving bipartisan support for a surge in Pentagon spending, setting up another potential boom for weapons makers that is likely to extend beyond the war in Ukraine.Congress is on track in the coming week to give final approval to a national military budget for the current fiscal year that is expected to reach approximately $858 billion — or $45 billion above what President Biden had requested.If approved at this level, the Pentagon budget will have grown at 4.3 percent per year over the last two years — even after inflation — compared with an average of less than 1 percent a year in real dollars between 2015 and 2021, according to an analysis by Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments for The New York Times.Spending on procurement would rise sharply next year, including a 55 percent jump in Army funding to buy new missiles and a 47 percent jump for the Navy’s weapons purchases.On Friday, Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden’s national security adviser, put the buildup in strategic terms, saying the war in Ukraine had exposed shortfalls in the nation’s military industrial base that needed to be addressed to ensure the United States is “able to support Ukraine and to be able to deal with contingencies elsewhere in the world.”Lockheed Martin, the nation’s largest military contractor, had booked more than $950 million worth of its own missile military orders from the Pentagon in part to refill stockpiles being used in Ukraine. 
1	The Army has awarded Raytheon Technologies more than $2 billion in contracts to deliver missile systems to expand or replenish weapons used to help Ukraine.
2	“We went through six years of Stingers in 10 months,” Gregory J. Hayes, Raytheon’s chief executive, said in an interview earlier this month, referring to 1,600 of the company’s shoulder-fired antiaircraft missiles sent by the U.S. government to Ukraine. 
3	“So it will take us multiple years to restock and replenish.”But those contracts are just the leading edge of what is shaping up to be a big new defense buildup. 
4	Military spending next year is on track to reach its highest level in inflation-adjusted terms since the peaks in the costs of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars between 2008 and 2011, and the second highest in inflation-adjusted terms since World War II — a level that is more than the budgets for the next 10 largest cabinet agencies combined.Even more orders are coming in to military contractors from U.S. allies in Europe and Asia, as they too have concluded they must do more to arm themselves against rising global threats. 
5	Japan moved this month to double its spending on defense over the next five years, putting aside a pacifist stand it has largely maintained since 1945.And none of this counts an estimated $18 billion of planned but now delayed weapons deliveries by the United States to arm Taiwan against a possible future attack by China.The combination of the Ukraine war and the growing consensus about the emergence of a new era of superpower confrontation is prompting efforts to ensure the military industrial base can respond to surges in demand. 
6	The issue has become urgent in some cases as the U.S. and its NATO allies seek to keep weapons flowing to Ukraine without diminishing their own stocks to worrisome levels.The Ukrainian military has run through years’ worth of the missile production capacity of Western suppliers in a matter of months. 
7	At the same time, contractors remain concerned about investing to meet growing demand for weapons that could dry up again when the war ends or politics shifts course.
8	“The difficulty of starting a production line back up, that doesn’t come for free,” Tom Arseneault, president of BAE Systems, which is now considering restarting its M777 howitzer manufacturing line, which the company had been in the process of shutting down. 
9	The M777 is a highly accurate, towed gun that fires 155-millimeter artillery shells, which are also in diminishing supply.The annual military authorization bill that passed the Senate on Thursday prevents the Air Force and Navy from retiring aging weapons systems that the military would like to take out of service, including certain C-130 transport planes or F-22 fighter jets. 
10	At the same time, it includes billions of dollars in extra money to build even more new ships and planes than the Pentagon itself asked for, including $2.2 billion alone for an extra Navy-guided missile destroyer, according to the Senate Armed Services Committee.And there is $678 million to expand ammunition plants in spots such as Scranton, Pa.
11	; Middletown, Iowa; and Kingsport, Tenn., where contractors work with the Army to manufacture the ammunition that Ukrainian artillery crews have burned through at an alarming rate. 
12	(The money for these programs is expected to be included in a huge appropriations bill that appears to be on track to pass Congress and signed into law by Mr. Biden by the end of the week.)Spending could be even higher, as Congress is also considering a request for an extra $21.7 billion for the Pentagon, above the already expanded 2023 annual budget, to allocate more money to resupply materials used in Ukraine.In an indication of how government policy is shifting to rebuild industrial capacity for the military, Congress this year has moved to allow the Defense Department to more broadly make multiyear spending commitments for certain weapons systems and shipbuilding operations. 
13	That is a provision that industry lobbyists have long pushed for, arguing it gives companies certainty that investments they make to start production will see continued returns in future years.
14	“We have to make a commitment with the industry,” said Senator Deb Fischer, Republican of Nebraska and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who supported the change. 
15	“Then the industry will step forward to restart or grow their production lines.”That move alone suggests $73 billion in additional munitions orders could be on the way in the next three years, contracts that will largely benefit the big players like Lockheed and Raytheon, according to an analysis by Myles Walton, a military industry analyst at Wolfe Research, a Wall Street research firm.These trends help explain stock market performance of the major military contractors — a small group of which control the bulk of sales to the Pentagon. 
16	Lockheed and Northrop Grumman both have seen their stock prices jump more than 35 percent so far this year in a market whose main indexes are down overall for the year.Opponents of higher military budgets say they are frustrated.Military contractors are “riding high again, and Ukraine just gives them another argument as to why things need to continue onward and upward,” said William D. Hartung, a fellow at the non-interventionist Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft.
17	“The trillion-dollar defense budget — that is where we are headed,” said Lawrence J. Korb, who served as an assistant defense secretary during the Reagan administration and was once a vice president at Raytheon. 
18	“Nobody seems to want to make the tough choices. Even the Democrats now seem to be afraid to be seen as being soft on defense.”The biggest barrier for growth for major military contractors — the list includes Lockheed, Raytheon, Boeing, General Dynamics, BAE, Northrop Grumman and Huntington Ingalls Industries — is finding sufficient supplies of key components, such as microelectronics and missile warheads, as well as a steady supply of new employees to assemble all these items.
19	“You cannot throw much more money at the seven shipbuilders that build U.S. warships in the United States of America right now,” Adm. Michael M. Gilday, the chief of naval operations, said this month during the Reagan National Defense Forum in California, referring to a $32.6 billion shipbuilding budget in the military authorization bill that is $4.7 billion more than the Pentagon requested. 
20	“Their capacity is about at max. And Congress is helping us max them out.”Raytheon, which has 180,000 workers, has hired 27,000 new employees so far this year, its chief executive said in October. 
21	But even with that, it is still running into bottlenecks in terms of available parts and labor shortages that are slowing sales, its executives said.The sheer scale of the munitions and missiles sent to Ukraine illustrates just how much matériel a war can consume.That includes more than 104 million rounds of small-arms ammunition, at least one million rounds of 155-millimeter artillery shells, 46,000 anti-tank weapons, more than 1,600 Stinger antiaircraft missiles and 8,500 Javelin anti-armor missiles, according to a Pentagon tally.The resupply challenge is not just a matter of money. 
22	Military contractors have nearly stopped manufacturing Stingers — Raytheon’s last contract from the U.S. government was in 2002, Mr. Haynes said. 
23	And while Javelins are still being made jointly by Raytheon and Lockheed — in September they were awarded a $311 million contract to deliver more of them — historically they have been able to make only about 2,100 a year, or about a quarter of what Ukraine has burned through since the outbreak of the war in February.In total, the Pentagon as of early December had awarded at least $6 billion to military contractors to resupply these and other items sent to Ukraine.
24	“We’re going to ramp up,” Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said this month. 
25	“We’ve really been working closely with industry to both increase their capacity and also the speed at which they’re able to produce.”The overall spending on national defense still remains relatively low as a percentage of the nation’s economy: about 3.2 percent of the gross domestic product this year, compared to 37 percent during World War II and 13 percent during the Korean War, according to Pentagon records.Still, companies are scrambling to avoid or resolve bottlenecks caused by the increase in demand.Lockheed, for example, spent more than $60 million of its own money in advance of getting Pentagon contract commitment to build more of its High Mobility Artillery Rocket System vehicles, or HIMARS, which fire guided rockets carrying 200 pounds of explosives that can hit targets nearly 50 miles away. 
26	The vehicles have been much sought after by Ukraine, which has used them to devastating effect against the Russians.Traditionally, Lockheed has been able to build 60 of these trucks per year, but it is now shifting production to 24 hours a day and seven days a week in an effort to bring that annual total to 96 units. 
27	It also now has a new $430 million contract to deliver more HIMARS, along with a new $521 million contract to build more of the rockets, called GMLRS, that these vehicles can fire.These resupply orders, while large in terms of many other contracts the federal government issues, are still relatively small for the biggest contractors. 
28	At Lockheed, for example, about 70 percent of sales come from the U.S. government, and most of the rest from other governments worldwide. 
29	Supply chain and labor shortage problems are cutting into sales and profits, including at Lockheed, which expects to see annual sales decline this year to $62.3 billion from $67 billion.
30	“The clutch is engaging but into some lower gears initially,” James Taiclet, Lockheed’s chief executive, said in October, adding that higher sales might not show up for another year.But there are more of the big-ticket orders coming. 
31	In the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Switzerland and Germany have both moved in recent months to finalize orders for the F-35 fighter jets, collectively worth $16 billion. 
32	Overall foreign military sales notifications to Congress so far in 2022 have totaled $81 billion, the third highest figure in the last 25 years, with an increasing share of these sales going to European and Asian nations.Next year’s military budget also includes major investments in new hypersonic weapons that are also being aggressively pursued by China. 
33	Raytheon and Northrop Grumman in September won a $1 billion contract just to build prototypes for the Air Force.Other companies want to replace older equipment sent to Ukraine with newer models. 
34	BAE, for example, intends to sell the Army more armored vehicles called AMPVs, in place of the more than 200 of BAE’s Vietnam-era M113 armored personnel carriers sent to Ukraine, which it no longer makes.
35	“Nothing’s cheap, right?” said Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro  this month at the conference in California, as he ran through many new investments the Navy is making. 
36	“Nothing’s free.”Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.
37	When Chris Licht told his boss, Stephen Colbert, the host of the CBS program “Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” in February that he had been offered the chief executive job at CNN, Mr. Colbert was blunt: “Definitely don’t go do that.”But for Mr. Licht, nothing less than democracy itself was at stake. 
38	He argued he could make CNN a news channel that people trusted, as opposed to one that monetized partisan combat.
39	“Oh, man, you used to be in news, remember?” 
40	Mr. Colbert recalled telling him. 
41	“You said this was so much nicer — 12 weeks off, good pay, laugh for an hour every night. Everyone is really nice; you can say anything you want, and nobody leaks it. It’s great.”“CNN would be lucky to get you,” Mr. Colbert continued. 
42	“But you’re my friend, and I’m telling you not to go.”“This is a calling,” Mr. Licht countered.At which point Mr. Colbert stopped trying to dissuade him: “I can’t negotiate with a calling.”On Feb. 28, Mr. Licht was named CNN’s new chief executive. 
43	Since then, he and Mr. Colbert have spoken nearly every Friday. 
44	Each time, Mr. Colbert begins with the same four words:“I told you so.”By almost any measure, Mr. Licht, 51, has had a rough start. 
45	His first major act was to kill the network’s fledgling streaming service, CNN+, and fire 400 or so people working on it. 
46	CNN’s revenue and profits have plunged to a projected $750 million this year, down from $1.25 billion last year, partly from the costs associated with CNN+, the network acknowledged. 
47	CNN’s ratings declined, on average, this year compared with 2021, according to Nielsen, with CNN falling behind MSNBC for the first time in prime time on election night among total viewers. 
48	(CNN prevailed in the coveted 25-to-54 age group.)At the end of November, Mr. Licht levied another round of job cuts — this time just under 10 percent of CNN’s work force of about 4,000, which plunged morale further. 
49	Among the casualties were familiar commentators like Chris Cillizza, key behind-the-scenes producers with decades of experience, and the entirety of HLN, CNN’s sister network, and its popular morning host, Robin Meade.A chorus of media pundits has pounced on every tidbit of bad news. 
50	Mr. Licht’s early programming efforts aimed at repositioning the network as broader and less partisan have prompted howls of criticism, with former MSNBC host and former colleague Keith Olbermann publicly calling Mr. Licht a “TV Fascist” after he moved Don Lemon, a liberal host, from a prime-time slot to a revamped morning show.
51	“The uninformed vitriol, especially from the left, has been stunning,” Mr. Licht said in one of several interviews with The New York Times spanning his nearly eight-month tenure. 
52	“Which proves my point: so much of what passes for news is name-calling, half-truths and desperation.”Mr. 
53	Licht said he was under no illusion that stepping into the chief executive job would be easy or make him popular. 
54	The network’s previous parent, the telecommunications giant AT&T, had just spun off its Warner Media subsidiary, which included CNN, into a new company run by Discovery’s chief executive, David Zaslav.Just two months before the companies merged and only weeks before CNN+ was introduced to the world, the network’s popular and longtime chief executive, Jeff Zucker, was forced to resign after failing to disclose a romantic relationship with his top lieutenant, Allison Gollust. 
55	Some at CNN felt Mr. Zucker had been unfairly sacrificed and remained staunchly loyal to their former boss.CNN had also become the poster child for the poisoned relationship between former President Donald J. Trump and mainstream media organizations. 
56	Mr. Trump repeatedly branded CNN as “fake news,” and his administration engaged in open warfare with CNN correspondents like Jim Acosta, whom Mr. Trump once called “a rude, terrible person” during a news conference. 
57	In 2018, CNN’s New York headquarters had to be evacuated after a bomb threat.CNN remained enviably profitable, earning over $1 billion a year for the past five years. 
58	But cable news, along with all cable channels, has been in secular decline, troubled by shifting viewer habits in an era of cord cutting and an exodus to streaming services and online news sites.It’s not clear anyone could surmount those challenges, let alone someone who’d just spent nearly six years at a late-night entertainment show and had never managed a complex, globe-spanning organization with thousands of employees.So why even take the job?
59	Mr. 
60	Licht seemed to have TV news in his DNA. 
61	As a child, he’d created a fictional TV news network, WBC, and produced his own newscast using a VCR camera in his basement in Newtown, Conn. 
62	At about the age of 9, he met the NBC legal correspondent Carl Stern on a family vacation and, in Mr. Licht’s telling, “stuck to him like glue.” 
63	Mr. Licht pried the newsman’s phone number from him and used it regularly. 
64	“I was obsessed,” Mr. Licht said. 
65	After college at Syracuse University, Mr. Licht landed jobs at NBC affiliates in Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
66	As a reporter and producer, he covered a mass shooting in San Bernardino, the plane crash that killed John F. Kennedy Jr., two presidential campaigns and three Olympics.In 2005, he moved to NBC’s sibling network, MSNBC, soon becoming an executive producer for “Morning Joe,” which he helped develop into an improbable success in its hotly competitive morning time slot. 
67	Notably, the two hosts, the former Republican politician Joe Scarborough and the more liberal former CBS correspondent Mika Brzezinski, straddled the political divide. 
68	The tension between them seemed to enhance their audience appeal. 
69	Mr. Licht encouraged them to be themselves and embrace the unexpected. 
70	(They later married.)Mr. 
71	Licht moved to CBS in 2010, where he’d scored another early morning success. 
72	He lifted ratings at the perennial also-ran “CBS This Morning” on the strength of the program’s three hosts, Charlie Rose, Gayle King and Norah O’Donnell, and an emphasis on news and in-depth interviews, rather than the lighter fare format of its competitors “Today” and “Good Morning America.”After having a brain aneurysm in 2010 when he was still under 40, Mr. Licht wrote a book about what he learned from the experience, while still describing himself as a “killer TV producer” with “no urge to surrender my spot in the fast lane,” even after the near-fatal incident.Restless after six years at “This Morning,” in 2016 he joined the then-faltering CBS program “Late Show With Stephen Colbert.” 
73	Within a year, Mr. Colbert had seized the late-night ratings crown from Jimmy Fallon of NBC’s “Tonight Show.”Soon after the Warner-Discovery deal was announced, Mr. Zaslav summoned Mr. Licht to Discovery’s headquarters in Manhattan on 19th Street and asked what he thought of CNN.Mr. 
74	Licht told him he had no interest in running it. 
75	“I got out of news, and I’m not going back,” Mr. Licht had insisted.Mr. 
76	Zaslav ignored the demurral. 
77	Over the next several weeks, he kept making the case to Mr. Licht. 
78	In fact, Mr. Zaslav said in an interview that he never considered anyone else for the job.The two men have known each other for 15 years, since both were working at NBC, where Mr. Zaslav helped start MSNBC. 
79	In the years since, they have had breakfast once a quarter. 
80	Mr. Licht has looked to Mr. Zaslav as a mentor, and Mr. Zaslav has admired Mr. Licht’s work ethic and drive.
81	“He’s a fighter, and he likes to win,” Mr. Zaslav said.At their first meeting, Mr. Zaslav argued that running CNN would be “a great opportunity to build the No. 1 news brand in the world,” and “the most trusted brand in news where people go every day and in a crisis for the best version of the truth.”And more than that: “This is important for America. It’s important for a functioning society.”Mr. 
82	Licht and Mr. Zaslav — not to mention Warner’s largest shareholder, the media mogul John Malone — were philosophically aligned. 
83	Fox and MSNBC were “advocacy” networks, as Mr. Zaslav put it, a proven business model appealing to like-minded viewers but of scant, if any, value as a public service. 
84	Whether by design or happenstance, he believed CNN had tacked left, a pale version of MSNBC that nonetheless alienated wide parts of the American electorate with a focus on politics and the president at the time, Mr. Trump.Ted Turner’s mantra had always been “the news is the star.” 
85	Mr. Trump “is not the star,” Mr. Zaslav said.Yet Mr. Licht was noncommittal. 
86	On a subsequent phone call, Mr. Zaslav urged Mr. Licht to think about CNN and whether he’d be interested in the top job. 
87	After Mr. Licht hung up, his wife, Jennifer Blanco Licht, a former TV executive herself, asked: “Is this crazy? I think you should do it.”The two men continued the conversation on a long walk in Central Park. 
88	(They both live near the park.) 
89	During that conversation, Mr. Zaslav warned Mr. Licht that he’d be closely scrutinized and judged harshly. 
90	Is your family ready for this? 
91	Are you ready for this? 
92	Because “it will be brutal,” Mr. Zaslav said.Mr. 
93	Licht said he doesn’t recall Mr. Zaslav ever offering him the job, or his accepting it. 
94	At one point, Mr. Zaslav simply asked, “Who’s your lawyer?” and started acting like Mr. Licht was CNN’s future chief executive. 
95	A contract ensued.On their first lunch afterward, at Mr. Zaslav’s usual corner table at Gramercy Tavern, Mr. Zaslav indicated their yearslong relationship had fundamentally changed. 
96	“We’ve been friends for 15 years,” Mr. Zaslav said. 
97	“We’re not friends any more. You work for me.”Almost immediately, their shared vision of saving democracy ran into the harsh reality of cable news economics.With Fox News and MSNBC having already staked out the right and left ends of the political spectrum, attracting the middle (what Mr. Licht referred to as “normal” people) has proved elusive. 
98	Mr. Zaslav had stressed that he didn’t care — at least not much — about CNN’s current ratings, revenue or profitability. 
99	He recognized that it would take years to reposition and rebuild the network. 
100	But even he had his limits.AT&T’s board had approved an ambitious budget of $350 million for CNN+, much of it already spent by the time Mr. Licht arrived. 
101	Many more millions would be needed. 
102	With Warner facing pressure from Wall Street to find $3 billion in savings, on April 21, Mr. Licht killed the streaming service after less than a month on air.In an effort to restore morale and calm anxiety, Mr. Licht assured CNN employees at a network-wide town hall meeting on May 5 that Warner Bros. 
103	Discovery didn’t anticipate further job cuts at CNN because there was no overlap between the news network and Discovery’s cable channels, and thus there wasn’t anyone else doing the same jobs that would need to be cut. 
104	In a series of additional town hall meetings, most of them leaked almost immediately to The New York Times and other news outlets, Mr. Licht also laid the groundwork for the network’s shift to broader, less political and less partisan coverage. 
105	This was not, he stressed repeatedly, a move to the “center,” a boring, political neutral zone that Mr. Licht wasn’t even sure existed. 
106	Rather, it was an attempt to explore controversial issues from varied perspectives — not to tell people “what to think,” as he put it, but “how to think,” or what he called a “blueprint for how to make decisions.”In July, Mr. Licht made a highly symbolic pilgrimage to Capitol Hill noteworthy for its inclusion of Republicans like the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, and Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas. 
107	Although he spent equal time with Democratic leaders like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Mr. Licht was irritated that his visit was billed as an “apology tour” and effort to coax Republicans back onto the network — part of CNN’s perceived move to the right.After long absences, several Republicans have since appeared on CNN, including Mr. McCarthy and Senator Rick Scott of Florida.Featuring hosts and guests with opposing points of view and playing up controversy has paid ratings dividends on cable in the past, notably on CNN’s own “Crossfire,” which came under criticism for evolving into to a verbal food fight criticized by the comedian Jon Stewart as “hurting America.”But Mr. Licht said he wasn’t interested in controversy for its own sake, but to offer a “rational conversation about polarizing issues.” 
108	After watching CNN, he hopes people will “take what they’ve heard to the dinner table and have a discussion,” he said. 
109	“That’s a dream of mine.”Two examples have been coverage of the abortion debate in the wake of the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade, and the debate over gun rights. 
110	To vocal criticism from the left, he hired Stephen Gutowski, founder and editor of The Reload, a firearms website. 
111	No one wants a school shooting, said Mr. Licht, whose hometown, Newtown, was the site of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre. 
112	“But we have to understand the culture of people who like guns,” he said.
113	“This is not vanilla, centrist or boring,” he added.Mr. 
114	Licht has barely begun to put his stamp on the network’s programming, but it’s already evident in the new morning show, “CNN This Morning.” 
115	Mr. Licht picked the hosts, persuading the left-leaning Don Lemon to trade his prime-time slot for early morning, and pairing him with the former Daily Caller reporter and CNN White House correspondent Kaitlan Collins and Poppy Harlow, a former host of “CNN Newsroom.” 
116	The show takes a somewhat similar approach to the one he used at “CBS This Morning” (which also shares a near-identical name).
117	In a series of interviews with The Times, Mr. Licht visibly came to life talking about “This Morning” and its co-hosts. 
118	“They obviously like each other,” he said. 
119	“The chemistry is great. I love the collaboration. Every day, it evolves. It’s not like me giving orders. It’s so much fun.”“This Morning” debuted on Nov. 1. 
120	The New York Post (which shares ownership with CNN’s rival, Fox News) reported the next day that “‘CNN This Morning’ bombs in debut,” drawing just 387,000 viewers, far behind rival morning shows and trailing its predecessor on CNN, “New Day.” 
121	CNN called the instant critique “absurd and cheap” after just one day’s data. 
122	(Since then, the show has gained slightly among total viewers.) 
123	More significantly, Mr. Licht noted, “This Morning” has broken news, including the chief Washington correspondent Jake Tapper’s scoop that Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona was leaving the Democratic Party to become an Independent.Prime time looms as an even greater challenge. 
124	In August, Mr. Licht moved Mr. Tapper from his 4 p.m. anchor position to the coveted 9 p.m. slot that had been vacated by Chris Cuomo after CNN fired him for what it deemed inappropriate efforts to help his brother, New York’s former governor, Andrew Cuomo, fend off the sexual harassment allegations that led to his resignation from office. 
125	The experiment with Mr. Tapper fared poorly in the ratings and lasted just one month.Mr. 
126	Licht acknowledged that prime time remains an “open canvas.” 
127	He said he and his colleagues were meeting and “throwing things against the wall, looking at off-the-beaten path opportunities.” 
128	Among the names tossed out have been entertainment, comedy and sports figures. 
129	He declined to be more specific but promised surprises.Miklos Sarvary, a professor and director of the media and technology program at Columbia Business School, said that entertainment was potentially more profitable than low-margin news. 
130	“But what does that do to the brand if you want to be the most trusted name in news?” he said. 
131	“News is supposed to be serious. I’m not sure that putting on a comedian is a great move for credibility.”Mr. 
132	Licht said he understood Mr. Sarvary’s point, but said prime time offered “some leeway for being a little different.”“It has to be compelling and entertaining without hurting the news brand,” he said, citing his former boss Mr. Colbert, and Mr. Stewart as “the kind of people who’d work,” while acknowledging that Mr. Stewart is already locked into a lucrative contract at Apple TV.Every Saturday, Mr. Licht sends Mr. Zaslav a memo with highlights of the week and programming and financial updates. 
133	Mr. Licht’s growth strategy is focused on CNN.com, which attracts more than 200 million unique visitors each month, according to CNN. 
134	But at its peak, CNN digital generated only about 10 percent of the network’s profits, Mr. Licht confirmed.On Oct. 13, Mr. Licht made his debut in front of Warner Brother Discovery’s board at a hotel in Los Angeles, where he outlined both his growth and content strategy. 
135	Asked about his efforts to make CNN less partisan, Mr. Licht gave this analogy: Suppose it’s raining outside. 
136	CNN plans to have people on who love the rain, and it will have people on who say they don’t like the rain. 
137	But it won’t have anyone on who says it’s sunny out.Mr. 
138	Licht said he used the analogy to make clear that a less-partisan CNN did not mean it was any less committed to truth. 
139	“This wasn’t to plot a new course but to assure people we would not let up one inch in being truth tellers,” he said. 
140	“The change is we will not do Trump 24/7 or let him dictate our agenda.”By all accounts, Mr. Licht’s presentation was warmly received by directors, including Mr. Malone.Mr. 
141	Licht’s vision is contending with industrywide pressures to cut costs. 
142	(He said he appreciates but doesn’t really believe Mr. Zaslav’s professed indifference to financial results.) 
143	By announcing the need for more layoffs on Oct. 26, he said he hoped to engage in a “transparent” process that would leave everyone feeling they’d been heard. 
144	But, he said, “it would be irresponsible not to do the tough work now.” 
145	He added, “I promise you CNN will be more profitable next year.”However transparent, many in CNN’s rank and file felt blindsided by the cuts, especially after what they perceived as his earlier reassurances that no further layoffs would be needed. 
146	In a all-staff meeting in November, Mr. Licht said he stood by his earlier remark that there would be no merger-related layoffs, and “I absolutely would not have said something that I did not believe to be true.” 
147	But he said he understood how his remarks had hurt his credibility. 
148	“I have to win that credibility back,” he acknowledged.Mr. 
149	Licht said the firings were the “low point” of his tenure so far.At another all-staff meeting this month, aimed at restoring morale, Mr. Licht took questions and then ended with a passage he wrote himself:In terms of morale, let me just say, you work at a world-renowned news organization alongside the best journalists on the globe. 
150	Your jobs have meaning. 
151	Your jobs have an impact. 
152	You are part of something bigger, of something with tremendous meaning. 
153	And nothing about that has changed. 
154	And you have in me as a leader, who has done a lot of your jobs, someone who has your back every step of the way. 
155	My loyalty is first and foremost to this organization and to journalism without fear or favor to anyone else, including our parent company.That’s why I’m here. 
156	That’s why I took this job.
157	“I want CNN to be essential to society,” Mr. Licht said in one of our interviews. 
158	“If you’re essential then the revenue will follow.”And if it doesn’t?
159	“Maybe it won’t work,” Mr. Licht conceded. 
160	“But I’d rather try to win this way.”Benjamin Mullin and Michael M. Grynbaum contributed reporting.
161	After three pandemic-battered years at the box office, Hollywood desperately wanted “Avatar: The Way of Water,” the sequel to the top-grossing film on record, to arrive like a ticket-selling tsunami. 
162	Surveys that track audience interest suggested that “The Way of Water” could arrive to as much as $175 million in opening-weekend ticket sales in the United States and Canada.It was not to be.The ultraexpensive event movie collected about $134 million at North American theaters over its first three days, according to Comscore, which compiles ticketing data. 
163	Directed by James Cameron and revisiting the fantasy world of Pandora, “The Way of Water” cost Disney an estimated $600 million to make and market. 
164	Three more sequels are planned.But there may still be a way for “The Way of Water” to become a big, blue juggernaut — possibly even surpassing the $2 billion in global sales that Cameron publicly set as the benchmark for financial success, given the film’s stratospheric production and marketing costs. 
165	Consider what happened with the first “Avatar” in 2009. 
166	It arrived to a soft $77 million and went on to gross $2.9 billion worldwide.
167	“It’s not the kind of movie that you can analyze by looking at how the first weekend did,” said Richard L. Gelfond, the chief executive of IMAX Corporation. 
168	“It’s all about how it holds on. I think the legs are going to be really strong.”IMAX is planning to play “The Way of Water” until the end of January, in part because there is very little competition until then. 
169	Studios typically flood theaters with spectacles at this time of year because the holidays leave so many people with time on their hands. 
170	But multiple event movies were pushed into 2023 because of pandemic-related slowdowns in production.AMC Entertainment, the world’s No. 1 multiplex operator, has more than 100,000 showtimes and 10 million seats on sale for “The Way of Water” through New Year’s Day in the United States alone.
171	“The Way of Water” also arrived in cinemas in almost every international market over the weekend, collecting an additional $300.5 million, for a healthy global opening total of $434.5 million, according to Disney. 
172	It was the second-highest global opening for the year, behind “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.”The top international market for “The Way of Water” was China, where the movie arrived to $57.1 million in ticket sales, despite restrictions on theater capacity in some major cities because of coronavirus outbreaks. 
173	Also in China, IMAX delivered its biggest opening weekend marketing share ever, accounting for 27 percent of the box office in the country on only 1 percent of total screens.In North America, an unusually large percentage of ticket sales for “The Way of Water” came from IMAX theaters and other premium-format locations, including those with 3-D presentation. 
174	Those venues accounted for 62 percent of the film’s domestic total, according to Disney. 
175	Some people may have had a difficult time finding tickets to such screenings — sellouts were common — and decided to wait, box office analysts said.
176	“The Way of Water,” an ecological parable that is a hybrid of live-action footage and specialized animation, has a marathon run time of three hours and 12 minutes, which may have been too much of a commitment for some people on the weekend before Christmas. 
177	But most box office analysts do not see length as a problem for “The Way of Water” in the long run, in part because reviews have been quite positive. 
178	Ticket buyers gave the movie an A grade in CinemaScore exit polls.
179	(The first “Avatar” was two hours and 42 minutes long. “The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,” with a run time of three hours and 29 minutes, holds the length record for a no-intermission, wide-release film, according to Comscore.)“Expectations aside, this is an outstanding opening,” said David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter on box office numbers, noting that “The Way of Water” arrived to stronger ticket sales than most superhero sequels. 
180	“The movie is set up for a very strong run,” he added.
181	The Russian soldier was named Dmitri Tsvigun. 
182	A table tennis coach from a small city in Siberia, he had volunteered to fight in Ukraine. 
183	But at age 30, he died from shrapnel wounds when a tank shell exploded near him in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk Province on Nov. 20.“He responded to a call from his heart to join the special military operation,” said a short memorial article in a local newspaper on Dec. 8. 
184	That brief account got Mr. Tsvigun added to a list of confirmed Russian war deaths maintained by a small, dedicated team of data journalists and volunteers, as the Kremlin has largely avoided updating the number publicly. 
185	Run by Mediazona, the independent Russian news outlet, with the BBC’s Russian service and about a dozen anonymous volunteers in Russia, the list pulls information from sources like newspaper articles, photographs on tombstones, fellow soldiers mourning their comrades and even tips from relatives who want their loved ones included in the tally.The list has surpassed 10,000 names, including more than 400 Russians drafted recently.
186	“If the Russian government does not count Russian casualties, then someone has to do it,” said David Frenkel, one of four data reporters from Mediazona running the project. 
187	“It is important for us to explain to Russians the cost of the war,” he added. 
188	“If they do not understand the cost from the pictures of devastated Ukrainian cities, then maybe the number of dead Russians will make them think about it.”The Russian government has tried to avoid just that by barely mentioning the death toll from the war it launched with the invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. 
189	It has updated the number exactly twice: once at the end of March and again in September, when the defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, said that 5,937 Russian troops had been killed since the war started.That official number is notably smaller than estimates from Western military and intelligence officials. 
190	Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for example, said in November that Moscow’s casualties were “well over 100,000 Russian soldiers killed and wounded.”There have been similar estimates for Ukrainian losses, with Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky, telling a Ukrainian news station this month that up to 13,000 Ukrainian troops had died in the conflict.With so much fog of war shrouding the subject, Mediazona decided that online sleuthing was needed to establish a baseline of Russian deaths. 
191	A scattered group of volunteers in Russia was already trying to document the deaths on their own, and the BBC News Russian service had done several articles on the subject, so they combined forces.They did not set out to document every death, and estimated that their Russian count was about one-third to half the true total. 
192	But by harvesting as much information as was available from social media posts and putting a name to every death listed, they figured their number was better than an estimate.
193	“It is not just about the number; it is about who died or how they died,” said Maxim Litavrin, another data journalist at Mediazona.Ukrainians upload a higgledy-piggledy stream of information about Russians killed in the war on several channels on the Telegram messaging application, including the names of the deceased. 
194	The team of volunteer investigators in Russia then search social media posts for the names. 
195	All the information from open sources ends up on a huge spreadsheet. 
196	The journalists work quickly to check the links and to back up everything because personal posts often disappear. 
197	They crosscheck names against a government website that lists people deceased throughout Russia but that does not specify military deaths.Seven out of 10 confirmations come from local news reports, the data journalists said, while the others are a mix. 
198	They include announcements from local officials or employers; individual posts on VKontakte, the Russian equivalent of Facebook; and sources like pictures of memorial plaques put up in dead soldiers’ former schools.Every two weeks, Mediazona crunches all the numbers to break down the toll on its website, including deaths by region, military unit and age.The results can vary drastically by region. 
199	In Dagestan, Russia, for example, where serving and dying in the Russian Army is considered an honor, officials tend to make statements about those killed.In some regions like Krasnodar, volunteers have counted hundreds of war dead by visiting cemeteries. 
200	Even temporary tombstones in Russian cemeteries usually include a picture of the deceased, along with the name, military unit, date of birth and date of death.
201	“Cemeteries give us a lot,” Mr. Frenkel said.Military analysts have mixed views on the project. 
202	Some prefer to work with estimates of the overall number killed rather than a slice of the total. 
203	Others stressed that the work had been especially helpful in identifying patterns.
204	“The project is a useful snapshot of the breakdowns and wider patterns in Russian losses,” said Karolina Hird, a Russia analyst at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War. 
205	“We know that Russian authorities are simply not presenting truthful reporting on losses.”One early pattern, for example, showed that about 20 percent of Russia’s war deaths were officers. 
206	“That told us a lot about how the Russian Army operates,” said Olga Ivshina, a reporter with the BBC Russian service who alternates with Mediazona each week to tally the numbers. 
207	It turned out that senior Russian officers were initially deployed near the front lines because junior officers could not issue orders.The information available online varies widely.A local community page posted pictures showing Alexander A. Dementov, 28, and Alexander Trokhov, 38, after they were drafted at the end of September. 
208	They were both workers at the Nadezhdinski Metallurgical Plant in Serov, a Russian city in the Urals. 
209	Then, a local newspaper reported on Dec. 7 that both men, who had served in the 55th motorized rifle brigade, died in a missile strike on Nov. 23.Sometimes, the details are sparse.Vsevolod Matveev was No. 10,000 on the spreadsheet. 
210	The data journalists discovered that he was from the Sverdlovsk region in the Urals and that he was buried on Dec. 9 in the town of Zarechny. 
211	From his picture, they could tell that he had served with a motorized infantry unit. 
212	But that was it.When deaths cannot be confirmed by open sources, the names are put on a side list awaiting further details. 
213	The Mediazona reporters noted that resistance to the wars in Afghanistan and Chechnya developed in tandem with the death toll, but there has been little sign of that in Russia.Spending every day scrolling through information about dead people is mentally taxing, they said, but certain posts stick with them. 
214	Mr. Litavrin remembers reading about a 40-year-old man who had a quiet, regular life and a daughter, and volunteered in August. 
215	He was killed after two weeks on the battlefield.
216	“I wondered what he was thinking,” Mr. Litavrin said. 
217	“It’s terrible.”
218	A well-known Catholic priest and incendiary leader of the anti-abortion movement was removed from the priesthood by the Vatican, according to a letter from Pope Francis’ representative to the United States that was obtained by The New York Times.Frank Pavone, who leads the advocacy organization Priests for Life, and was once a religious adviser to former President Donald J. Trump, was dismissed from the clergy on Nov. 9 with no possibility of appeal, the letter states. 
219	The letter included a statement about the removal, called laicization, that it said was approved by the Dicastery for the Clergy, a Vatican office.
220	“This action was taken after Father Pavone was found guilty in canonical proceedings of blasphemous communications on social media, and of persistent disobedience of the lawful instructions of his diocesan bishop,” it states.The letter did not specify those communications or disobedience, or name the diocesan bishop.  
221	Reached by phone on Sunday morning, Mr. Pavone said that he had not been properly notified of the decision.
222	“I’m waiting for them to point out to me what I did wrong that merits something like this,” he said. 
223	And though the Vatican has said there was no possibility of appeal, Mr. Pavone said that ultimately he and his allies “would have to appeal to the next pope” and “to the people of God.”The punishment of a high-profile Catholic anti-abortion activist comes at a precarious moment for the movement as it plans its future after losses in the midterm election and struggles to unify Republicans around the issue. 
224	Mr. Pavone’s anti-abortion activism was not cited in the letter as the reason for his dismissal.The move also comes a month after the Catholic bishops of the United States said they would redouble their efforts to end abortion and elected new leaders who are expected to continue the conservative leanings of the hierarchy.Mr. 
225	Pavone, a ubiquitous figure at anti-abortion rallies and fund-raisers, is prolific on social media. 
226	By his own account, his outspoken anti-abortion activism has won the support of some church leaders over the years but has also led to clashes with others.He is also known in the anti-abortion movement for his relationship with Norma McCorvey, the ‘Jane Roe’ of Roe v. Wade, whose lawsuit led to the U.S. Supreme Court decision nearly 50 years ago to enshrine the right to abortion in the Constitution. 
227	Ms. McCorvey later converted to Catholicism and the anti-abortion cause, at least for a time. 
228	The court rescinded the right this summer.Mr. 
229	Pavone was devoted to Mr. Trump and was among those who questioned the results of the 2020 election.His dismissal was first reported by the conservative outlet Catholic News Agency on Saturday night.On a live broadcast on social media shortly after the report, Mr. Pavone said he had received no communication from the Vatican about his removal. 
230	Wearing a leather jacket over his priest’s collar, he said he would continue his work for the anti-abortion cause.
231	“I’ve been persecuted in the church for decades, decades. This is nothing new for me,” he said. 
232	“They just don’t like the work I’m doing for these babies.”He seemed to refer to a comment on Twitter from 2020 in which he referred to “supporters of this goddamn loser Biden and his morally corrupt, America-hating, God hating Democrat party.”“I used the word G-D in a response to somebody in a tweet and for that they want to throw me out of the priesthood,” he said.The letter about his removal makes no specific reference to this incident, or to abortion beyond his affiliation.Online, Mr. Pavone seemed to compare his removal itself to abortion.
233	“In every profession, including the priesthood, if you defend the #unborn, you will be treated like them!” he wrote on Twitter on Saturday night. 
234	“The only difference is that when we are ‘aborted,’ we continue to speak, loud and clear.”Archbishop Christophe Pierre, the Pope’s representative to the United States, called the apostolic nuncio, addressed the letter dated Dec. 13 to bishops, alerting them of the decision from the Vatican. 
235	The New York Times obtained the letter from a person who had access to it but who was not authorized to share it.
236	“As you will know, Father Pavone was a very public and high profile figure associated with the Right to Life Movement in the U.S.,” Archbishop Pierre states. 
237	“His dismissal from the clerical state may, therefore, be a matter of interest among the faithful. In anticipation of that potential interest, the attached statement regarding Father Pavone is provided for your information.”The statement said that Mr. Pavone was given “ample opportunity to defend himself” as well as “multiple opportunities to submit himself to the authority of his diocesan bishop.”“It was determined that Father Pavone had no reasonable justification for his actions,” it says.The statement said the future of Mr. Pavone’s role at Priests for Life would be entirely up to the group, which it described as “not a Catholic organization.”In his broadcast, Mr. Pavone said, “You can’t cancel this message, you won’t silence this message. It’s only going to grow. We’re only going to get louder.”During the 2016 presidential election, Mr. Pavone posted a live video on Facebook in which he put an aborted fetus on what appeared to be an altar. 
238	The Diocese of Amarillo in Texas, which oversaw him at the time, announced that it opened an investigation into Mr. Pavone as a result. 
239	The diocese did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday night.Mr. 
240	Pavone clashed publicly with the bishop of the Diocese of Amarillo, Patrick Zurek, several times over the years. 
241	In the fall of 2020, the diocese issued a statement saying Catholics should disregard Mr. Pavone’s rhetoric about the election, including comments online about withholding the absolution of sin from Catholics who voted Democratic.
242	“These postings are not consistent with Catholic Church Teachings,” the diocese said in a statement at the time. 
243	“Please disregard them and pray for Father Pavone.”In the interview on Sunday, Mr. Pavone said that he believed the removal process stemmed from the Amarillo investigation. 
244	He said that he had previously told church authorities he would not participate in the process, which he saw as “tainted.” 
245	Following the report of his dismissal, Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, defended Mr. Pavone as “the one priest devoted most over the years” to taking action and building support for the anti-abortion cause, and said that she would continue to lean on him going forward.
246	“He and I see it the same way: This is the very beginning of the pro-life movement, and he has only just gotten started,” she said. 
247	Eric Scheidler, the executive director of the Pro-Life Action League, which has a long relationship with Mr. Pavone, said it was “hard to see an organization called Priests for Life headed by a man who’s not recognized as a priest by any local bishop.”Mr. 
248	Pavone’s removal could rattle his fellow activists at a sensitive time, said Mr. Scheidler, who is Catholic.
249	“It’s a time of real soul-searching and challenges for the pro-life movement as we try to rebuild after the backlash to the overturning of Roe v. Wade,” he said.
250	On the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, as scores of Proud Boys were getting ready to take their place in a pro-Trump mob outside the Capitol, a leader of the far-right group sent a message to his colleagues.
251	“I want to see thousands of normies burn that city to ash today,” he wrote.Almost two years later, the notion that the Proud Boys wanted to provoke violence among the “normies” — or the normal people — in the crowd that day rests at the heart of the government’s case against five members of the group who are facing trial on charges of seditious conspiracy in connection with the Capitol attack.At the trial, which begins with jury selection on Monday, prosecutors intend to argue that the five defendants turned the mob into a weapon on Jan. 6 and pointed it at the Capitol, where lawmakers had gathered to certify the results of the 2020 election, according to court papers and pretrial hearings. 
252	It was all part of a plot, the government will say, to stop the lawful transfer of power and ensure that President Donald J. Trump remained in office.The Proud Boys trial is opening in Federal District Court in Washington less than a month after Stewart Rhodes, the leader of another far-right group, the Oath Keepers militia, was convicted along with one of his lieutenants of seditious conspiracy at a separate trial in the same courthouse, which sits within sight of the domed Capitol building.While prosecutors could have taken the five Proud Boys to trial on relatively simple charges like trespassing or interfering with law enforcement officers, they instead aimed higher and charged sedition, which carries a hefty 20-year maximum sentence and has much more serious political connotations. 
253	But by doing so, the government has assumed the burden of proving that the defendants plotted in advance of Jan. 6 to use force to oppose the authority of the U.S. government or to interfere with the execution of federal laws — in this case, those that govern the transfer of presidential power.Much as in Mr. Rhodes’s trial, the government’s presentation in the Proud Boys trial will seek to bolster its sedition charges with thousands of internal text messages seized by the government and insider testimony from cooperating witnesses. 
254	But the differences between the two proceedings may be more instructive than their similarities.For one thing, prosecutors never accused Mr. Rhodes and his four co-defendants of personally committing serious acts of violence at the Capitol. 
255	Instead, they proved that the Oath Keepers plotted to use force against the government by pointing out that the group persistently said a civil war might be needed to fight the administration of Joseph R. Biden Jr. and that on Jan. 6 it stashed an arsenal of high-powered weapons in hotel rooms in Virginia.But in trying the Proud Boys, prosecutors plan to take a different tack: They will offer the jury a detailed account of how the five defendants — including Enrique Tarrio, the group’s former chairman — led their own troops and other “tools” in the mob into battle at the Capitol and played a central role in breaches of the building and in hand-to-hand fights with the police.Founded in 2016 during Mr. Trump’s first run for office, the Proud Boys have long described themselves as “Western chauvinists” out to protect American politics from the supposedly corrosive effects of modern liberal culture.But something else has always simmered beneath that public guise: a toxic stew of male grievance, misogyny, Islamophobia and anti-gay hatred, as well as a veneration of violence that has often boiled over into brawling in the streets.The government plans to tell some of that history at the trial and to demonstrate how the Proud Boys, under Mr. Tarrio’s leadership, became involved in pro-Trump rallies in Washington after the election. 
256	At one of those events, on Dec. 12, 2020, Mr. Tarrio burned a Black Lives Matter banner that had been hanging at a local Black church; other members of the group clashed with leftist counterprotesters, resulting in a Proud Boys leader, Jeremy Bertino, getting stabbed.A lingering effect of that incident, prosecutors plan to argue, is that it turned the Proud Boys against the police after years of having troublingly close relationships with officers across the country. 
257	The government wants to show the jury how the group became disillusioned with law enforcement to explain the events of Jan. 6, when members of the Proud Boys took the lead in assaulting the police.One week after the December rally, Mr. Trump posted a message on Twitter that announced another protest — which he said would be “wild” — in Washington on Jan. 6. 
258	Prosecutors will try to show that the Proud Boys heard the message as a clarion call and sprang into action.Working with a group of his top lieutenants, prosecutors say, Mr. Tarrio put together a handpicked crew of “rally boys” who would take the lead in the Proud Boys’ efforts on Jan. 6. 
259	The rank-and-file members of the group, Mr. Tarrio later said, would work in 10-man teams that day with medics and communications experts.Mr. 
260	Tarrio was not at the Capitol on Jan. 6, having been kicked out of Washington by a local judge after he returned to the city two days earlier and was arrested over the banner-burning incident and for carrying two high-capacity firearm magazines.But prosecutors plan to argue to the jury that three of his co-defendants — Joseph Biggs of Ormond Beach, Fla.
261	; Ethan Nordean of Auburn, Wash.
262	; and Zachary Rehl of Philadelphia — took the lead on the ground that day. 
263	A fourth co-defendant — Dominic Pezzola of Rochester, N.Y. — is best known for having broken one of the first windows at the Capitol with a stolen police riot shield.As part of the government’s case, jurors are also likely to hear from several former Proud Boys who have since pleaded guilty, including two from North Carolina: Mr. Bertino and Charles Donohoe. 
264	The government may also seek to introduce evidence about a document called “1776 Returns” that was given to Mr. Tarrio by one of his girlfriends and detailed a plan to surveil and storm several government buildings around the Capitol on Jan. 6.Recent court filings suggest that the lawyers for the Proud Boys intend to mount a robust defense. 
265	Echoing the lawyers in the Oath Keepers case, their central argument will be to claim that while the defendants breached the Capitol building, they did not plan the attack in any way that rose to the level of seditious conspiracy.Indeed, the lawyers have claimed in court papers that many of the government’s own witnesses have provided statements to prosecutors contradicting the assertion that the Proud Boys had any sort of plan to assault the Capitol. 
266	The lawyers have also maintained that the F.B.I. had as many as eight informants in the group before Jan. 6 and that none of them reported back about an intent to storm the building, raising questions, as one lawyer wrote, about “whether a Proud Boy conspiracy plan” to commit sedition “ever existed or could have existed.”In a more general sense, the defense will seek to persuade the jury that the Proud Boys are not racist brawlers, as they are often portrayed by the media, but more like what the founder of the group, Gavin McInnes, has long described them as: a patriotic men’s drinking club. 
267	At one point, the lawyers had thought they might call Mr. McInnes as a witness for the defense, but that remains unclear.Still, the jury is likely to get a glimpse of Proud Boys culture as the lawyers relate how dozens of members of the group descended on Washington to support Mr. Trump on Jan. 6, with some of the leaders moving into an Airbnb rental apartment near Chinatown.As evidence that the Proud Boys had no plan to attack the Capitol, the lawyers may tell the jurors how a musician friendly to the group — Michale Graves, the former lead singer for the punk band Misfits — was supposed to give a private concert at the rental apartment on the afternoon or evening of Jan. 6.The lawyers have also accused the government of threatening to bring charges against several other people the defense wants to call as witnesses at the trial.In court papers, the lawyers said they wanted to introduce testimony from Shannon Rusch, a former member of the Navy SEALs who marched with Mr. Biggs and Mr. Nordean toward the Capitol on Jan. 6, and Adrienna DiCioccio, a right-wing political organizer who was also at the building. 
268	But they claim the government is still investigating both Mr. Rusch’s family and Ms. DiCioccio, and has effectively scared them away from taking the stand.The lawyers have raised similar claims about a veteran Washington police officer, Lt. Shane Lamond, who could tell the jury how Mr. Tarrio was in constant contact with him before and during Jan. 6. 
269	But prosecutors have been investigating Lieutenant Lamond’s relationship with Mr. Tarrio for several months, and his lawyer has said he will most likely invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination if called as a witness.
270	When Chris Licht told his boss, Stephen Colbert, the host of the CBS program “Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” in February that he had been offered the chief executive job at CNN, Mr. Colbert was blunt: “Definitely don’t go do that.”But for Mr. Licht, nothing less than democracy itself was at stake. 
271	He argued he could make CNN a news channel that people trusted, as opposed to one that monetized partisan combat.
272	“Oh, man, you used to be in news, remember?” 
273	Mr. Colbert recalled telling him. 
274	“You said this was so much nicer — 12 weeks off, good pay, laugh for an hour every night. Everyone is really nice; you can say anything you want, and nobody leaks it. It’s great.”“CNN would be lucky to get you,” Mr. Colbert continued. 
275	“But you’re my friend, and I’m telling you not to go.”“This is a calling,” Mr. Licht countered.At which point Mr. Colbert stopped trying to dissuade him: “I can’t negotiate with a calling.”On Feb. 28, Mr. Licht was named CNN’s new chief executive. 
276	Since then, he and Mr. Colbert have spoken nearly every Friday. 
277	Each time, Mr. Colbert begins with the same four words:“I told you so.”By almost any measure, Mr. Licht, 51, has had a rough start. 
278	His first major act was to kill the network’s fledgling streaming service, CNN+, and fire 400 or so people working on it. 
279	CNN’s revenue and profits have plunged to a projected $750 million this year, down from $1.25 billion last year, partly from the costs associated with CNN+, the network acknowledged. 
280	CNN’s ratings declined, on average, this year compared with 2021, according to Nielsen, with CNN falling behind MSNBC for the first time in prime time on election night among total viewers. 
281	(CNN prevailed in the coveted 25-to-54 age group.)At the end of November, Mr. Licht levied another round of job cuts — this time just under 10 percent of CNN’s work force of about 4,000, which plunged morale further. 
282	Among the casualties were familiar commentators like Chris Cillizza, key behind-the-scenes producers with decades of experience, and the entirety of HLN, CNN’s sister network, and its popular morning host, Robin Meade.A chorus of media pundits has pounced on every tidbit of bad news. 
283	Mr. Licht’s early programming efforts aimed at repositioning the network as broader and less partisan have prompted howls of criticism, with former MSNBC host and former colleague Keith Olbermann publicly calling Mr. Licht a “TV Fascist” after he moved Don Lemon, a liberal host, from a prime-time slot to a revamped morning show.
284	“The uninformed vitriol, especially from the left, has been stunning,” Mr. Licht said in one of several interviews with The New York Times spanning his nearly eight-month tenure. 
285	“Which proves my point: so much of what passes for news is name-calling, half-truths and desperation.”Mr. 
286	Licht said he was under no illusion that stepping into the chief executive job would be easy or make him popular. 
287	The network’s previous parent, the telecommunications giant AT&T, had just spun off its Warner Media subsidiary, which included CNN, into a new company run by Discovery’s chief executive, David Zaslav.Just two months before the companies merged and only weeks before CNN+ was introduced to the world, the network’s popular and longtime chief executive, Jeff Zucker, was forced to resign after failing to disclose a romantic relationship with his top lieutenant, Allison Gollust. 
288	Some at CNN felt Mr. Zucker had been unfairly sacrificed and remained staunchly loyal to their former boss.CNN had also become the poster child for the poisoned relationship between former President Donald J. Trump and mainstream media organizations. 
289	Mr. Trump repeatedly branded CNN as “fake news,” and his administration engaged in open warfare with CNN correspondents like Jim Acosta, whom Mr. Trump once called “a rude, terrible person” during a news conference. 
290	In 2018, CNN’s New York headquarters had to be evacuated after a bomb threat.CNN remained enviably profitable, earning over $1 billion a year for the past five years. 
291	But cable news, along with all cable channels, has been in secular decline, troubled by shifting viewer habits in an era of cord cutting and an exodus to streaming services and online news sites.It’s not clear anyone could surmount those challenges, let alone someone who’d just spent nearly six years at a late-night entertainment show and had never managed a complex, globe-spanning organization with thousands of employees.So why even take the job?
292	Mr. 
293	Licht seemed to have TV news in his DNA. 
294	As a child, he’d created a fictional TV news network, WBC, and produced his own newscast using a VCR camera in his basement in Newtown, Conn. 
295	At about the age of 9, he met the NBC legal correspondent Carl Stern on a family vacation and, in Mr. Licht’s telling, “stuck to him like glue.” 
296	Mr. Licht pried the newsman’s phone number from him and used it regularly. 
297	“I was obsessed,” Mr. Licht said. 
298	After college at Syracuse University, Mr. Licht landed jobs at NBC affiliates in Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
299	As a reporter and producer, he covered a mass shooting in San Bernardino, the plane crash that killed John F. Kennedy Jr., two presidential campaigns and three Olympics.In 2005, he moved to NBC’s sibling network, MSNBC, soon becoming an executive producer for “Morning Joe,” which he helped develop into an improbable success in its hotly competitive morning time slot. 
300	Notably, the two hosts, the former Republican politician Joe Scarborough and the more liberal former CBS correspondent Mika Brzezinski, straddled the political divide. 
301	The tension between them seemed to enhance their audience appeal. 
302	Mr. Licht encouraged them to be themselves and embrace the unexpected. 
303	(They later married.)Mr. 
304	Licht moved to CBS in 2010, where he’d scored another early morning success. 
305	He lifted ratings at the perennial also-ran “CBS This Morning” on the strength of the program’s three hosts, Charlie Rose, Gayle King and Norah O’Donnell, and an emphasis on news and in-depth interviews, rather than the lighter fare format of its competitors “Today” and “Good Morning America.”After having a brain aneurysm in 2010 when he was still under 40, Mr. Licht wrote a book about what he learned from the experience, while still describing himself as a “killer TV producer” with “no urge to surrender my spot in the fast lane,” even after the near-fatal incident.Restless after six years at “This Morning,” in 2016 he joined the then-faltering CBS program “Late Show With Stephen Colbert.” 
306	Within a year, Mr. Colbert had seized the late-night ratings crown from Jimmy Fallon of NBC’s “Tonight Show.”Soon after the Warner-Discovery deal was announced, Mr. Zaslav summoned Mr. Licht to Discovery’s headquarters in Manhattan on 19th Street and asked what he thought of CNN.Mr. 
307	Licht told him he had no interest in running it. 
308	“I got out of news, and I’m not going back,” Mr. Licht had insisted.Mr. 
309	Zaslav ignored the demurral. 
310	Over the next several weeks, he kept making the case to Mr. Licht. 
311	In fact, Mr. Zaslav said in an interview that he never considered anyone else for the job.The two men have known each other for 15 years, since both were working at NBC, where Mr. Zaslav helped start MSNBC. 
312	In the years since, they have had breakfast once a quarter. 
313	Mr. Licht has looked to Mr. Zaslav as a mentor, and Mr. Zaslav has admired Mr. Licht’s work ethic and drive.
314	“He’s a fighter, and he likes to win,” Mr. Zaslav said.At their first meeting, Mr. Zaslav argued that running CNN would be “a great opportunity to build the No. 1 news brand in the world,” and “the most trusted brand in news where people go every day and in a crisis for the best version of the truth.”And more than that: “This is important for America. It’s important for a functioning society.”Mr. 
315	Licht and Mr. Zaslav — not to mention Warner’s largest shareholder, the media mogul John Malone — were philosophically aligned. 
316	Fox and MSNBC were “advocacy” networks, as Mr. Zaslav put it, a proven business model appealing to like-minded viewers but of scant, if any, value as a public service. 
317	Whether by design or happenstance, he believed CNN had tacked left, a pale version of MSNBC that nonetheless alienated wide parts of the American electorate with a focus on politics and the president at the time, Mr. Trump.Ted Turner’s mantra had always been “the news is the star.” 
318	Mr. Trump “is not the star,” Mr. Zaslav said.Yet Mr. Licht was noncommittal. 
319	On a subsequent phone call, Mr. Zaslav urged Mr. Licht to think about CNN and whether he’d be interested in the top job. 
320	After Mr. Licht hung up, his wife, Jennifer Blanco Licht, a former TV executive herself, asked: “Is this crazy? I think you should do it.”The two men continued the conversation on a long walk in Central Park. 
321	(They both live near the park.) 
322	During that conversation, Mr. Zaslav warned Mr. Licht that he’d be closely scrutinized and judged harshly. 
323	Is your family ready for this? 
324	Are you ready for this? 
325	Because “it will be brutal,” Mr. Zaslav said.Mr. 
326	Licht said he doesn’t recall Mr. Zaslav ever offering him the job, or his accepting it. 
327	At one point, Mr. Zaslav simply asked, “Who’s your lawyer?” and started acting like Mr. Licht was CNN’s future chief executive. 
328	A contract ensued.On their first lunch afterward, at Mr. Zaslav’s usual corner table at Gramercy Tavern, Mr. Zaslav indicated their yearslong relationship had fundamentally changed. 
329	“We’ve been friends for 15 years,” Mr. Zaslav said. 
330	“We’re not friends any more. You work for me.”Almost immediately, their shared vision of saving democracy ran into the harsh reality of cable news economics.With Fox News and MSNBC having already staked out the right and left ends of the political spectrum, attracting the middle (what Mr. Licht referred to as “normal” people) has proved elusive. 
331	Mr. Zaslav had stressed that he didn’t care — at least not much — about CNN’s current ratings, revenue or profitability. 
332	He recognized that it would take years to reposition and rebuild the network. 
333	But even he had his limits.AT&T’s board had approved an ambitious budget of $350 million for CNN+, much of it already spent by the time Mr. Licht arrived. 
334	Many more millions would be needed. 
335	With Warner facing pressure from Wall Street to find $3 billion in savings, on April 21, Mr. Licht killed the streaming service after less than a month on air.In an effort to restore morale and calm anxiety, Mr. Licht assured CNN employees at a network-wide town hall meeting on May 5 that Warner Bros. 
336	Discovery didn’t anticipate further job cuts at CNN because there was no overlap between the news network and Discovery’s cable channels, and thus there wasn’t anyone else doing the same jobs that would need to be cut. 
337	In a series of additional town hall meetings, most of them leaked almost immediately to The New York Times and other news outlets, Mr. Licht also laid the groundwork for the network’s shift to broader, less political and less partisan coverage. 
338	This was not, he stressed repeatedly, a move to the “center,” a boring, political neutral zone that Mr. Licht wasn’t even sure existed. 
339	Rather, it was an attempt to explore controversial issues from varied perspectives — not to tell people “what to think,” as he put it, but “how to think,” or what he called a “blueprint for how to make decisions.”In July, Mr. Licht made a highly symbolic pilgrimage to Capitol Hill noteworthy for its inclusion of Republicans like the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, and Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas. 
340	Although he spent equal time with Democratic leaders like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Mr. Licht was irritated that his visit was billed as an “apology tour” and effort to coax Republicans back onto the network — part of CNN’s perceived move to the right.After long absences, several Republicans have since appeared on CNN, including Mr. McCarthy and Senator Rick Scott of Florida.Featuring hosts and guests with opposing points of view and playing up controversy has paid ratings dividends on cable in the past, notably on CNN’s own “Crossfire,” which came under criticism for evolving into to a verbal food fight criticized by the comedian Jon Stewart as “hurting America.”But Mr. Licht said he wasn’t interested in controversy for its own sake, but to offer a “rational conversation about polarizing issues.” 
341	After watching CNN, he hopes people will “take what they’ve heard to the dinner table and have a discussion,” he said. 
342	“That’s a dream of mine.”Two examples have been coverage of the abortion debate in the wake of the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade, and the debate over gun rights. 
343	To vocal criticism from the left, he hired Stephen Gutowski, founder and editor of The Reload, a firearms website. 
344	No one wants a school shooting, said Mr. Licht, whose hometown, Newtown, was the site of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre. 
345	“But we have to understand the culture of people who like guns,” he said.
346	“This is not vanilla, centrist or boring,” he added.Mr. 
347	Licht has barely begun to put his stamp on the network’s programming, but it’s already evident in the new morning show, “CNN This Morning.” 
348	Mr. Licht picked the hosts, persuading the left-leaning Don Lemon to trade his prime-time slot for early morning, and pairing him with the former Daily Caller reporter and CNN White House correspondent Kaitlan Collins and Poppy Harlow, a former host of “CNN Newsroom.” 
349	The show takes a somewhat similar approach to the one he used at “CBS This Morning” (which also shares a near-identical name).
350	In a series of interviews with The Times, Mr. Licht visibly came to life talking about “This Morning” and its co-hosts. 
351	“They obviously like each other,” he said. 
352	“The chemistry is great. I love the collaboration. Every day, it evolves. It’s not like me giving orders. It’s so much fun.”“This Morning” debuted on Nov. 1. 
353	The New York Post (which shares ownership with CNN’s rival, Fox News) reported the next day that “‘CNN This Morning’ bombs in debut,” drawing just 387,000 viewers, far behind rival morning shows and trailing its predecessor on CNN, “New Day.” 
354	CNN called the instant critique “absurd and cheap” after just one day’s data. 
355	(Since then, the show has gained slightly among total viewers.) 
356	More significantly, Mr. Licht noted, “This Morning” has broken news, including the chief Washington correspondent Jake Tapper’s scoop that Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona was leaving the Democratic Party to become an Independent.Prime time looms as an even greater challenge. 
357	In August, Mr. Licht moved Mr. Tapper from his 4 p.m. anchor position to the coveted 9 p.m. slot that had been vacated by Chris Cuomo after CNN fired him for what it deemed inappropriate efforts to help his brother, New York’s former governor, Andrew Cuomo, fend off the sexual harassment allegations that led to his resignation from office. 
358	The experiment with Mr. Tapper fared poorly in the ratings and lasted just one month.Mr. 
359	Licht acknowledged that prime time remains an “open canvas.” 
360	He said he and his colleagues were meeting and “throwing things against the wall, looking at off-the-beaten path opportunities.” 
361	Among the names tossed out have been entertainment, comedy and sports figures. 
362	He declined to be more specific but promised surprises.Miklos Sarvary, a professor and director of the media and technology program at Columbia Business School, said that entertainment was potentially more profitable than low-margin news. 
363	“But what does that do to the brand if you want to be the most trusted name in news?” he said. 
364	“News is supposed to be serious. I’m not sure that putting on a comedian is a great move for credibility.”Mr. 
365	Licht said he understood Mr. Sarvary’s point, but said prime time offered “some leeway for being a little different.”“It has to be compelling and entertaining without hurting the news brand,” he said, citing his former boss Mr. Colbert, and Mr. Stewart as “the kind of people who’d work,” while acknowledging that Mr. Stewart is already locked into a lucrative contract at Apple TV.Every Saturday, Mr. Licht sends Mr. Zaslav a memo with highlights of the week and programming and financial updates. 
366	Mr. Licht’s growth strategy is focused on CNN.com, which attracts more than 200 million unique visitors each month, according to CNN. 
367	But at its peak, CNN digital generated only about 10 percent of the network’s profits, Mr. Licht confirmed.On Oct. 13, Mr. Licht made his debut in front of Warner Brother Discovery’s board at a hotel in Los Angeles, where he outlined both his growth and content strategy. 
368	Asked about his efforts to make CNN less partisan, Mr. Licht gave this analogy: Suppose it’s raining outside. 
369	CNN plans to have people on who love the rain, and it will have people on who say they don’t like the rain. 
370	But it won’t have anyone on who says it’s sunny out.Mr. 
371	Licht said he used the analogy to make clear that a less-partisan CNN did not mean it was any less committed to truth. 
372	“This wasn’t to plot a new course but to assure people we would not let up one inch in being truth tellers,” he said. 
373	“The change is we will not do Trump 24/7 or let him dictate our agenda.”By all accounts, Mr. Licht’s presentation was warmly received by directors, including Mr. Malone.Mr. 
374	Licht’s vision is contending with industrywide pressures to cut costs. 
375	(He said he appreciates but doesn’t really believe Mr. Zaslav’s professed indifference to financial results.) 
376	By announcing the need for more layoffs on Oct. 26, he said he hoped to engage in a “transparent” process that would leave everyone feeling they’d been heard. 
377	But, he said, “it would be irresponsible not to do the tough work now.” 
378	He added, “I promise you CNN will be more profitable next year.”However transparent, many in CNN’s rank and file felt blindsided by the cuts, especially after what they perceived as his earlier reassurances that no further layoffs would be needed. 
379	In a all-staff meeting in November, Mr. Licht said he stood by his earlier remark that there would be no merger-related layoffs, and “I absolutely would not have said something that I did not believe to be true.” 
380	But he said he understood how his remarks had hurt his credibility. 
381	“I have to win that credibility back,” he acknowledged.Mr. 
382	Licht said the firings were the “low point” of his tenure so far.At another all-staff meeting this month, aimed at restoring morale, Mr. Licht took questions and then ended with a passage he wrote himself:In terms of morale, let me just say, you work at a world-renowned news organization alongside the best journalists on the globe. 
383	Your jobs have meaning. 
384	Your jobs have an impact. 
385	You are part of something bigger, of something with tremendous meaning. 
386	And nothing about that has changed. 
387	And you have in me as a leader, who has done a lot of your jobs, someone who has your back every step of the way. 
388	My loyalty is first and foremost to this organization and to journalism without fear or favor to anyone else, including our parent company.That’s why I’m here. 
389	That’s why I took this job.
390	“I want CNN to be essential to society,” Mr. Licht said in one of our interviews. 
391	“If you’re essential then the revenue will follow.”And if it doesn’t?
392	“Maybe it won’t work,” Mr. Licht conceded. 
393	“But I’d rather try to win this way.”Benjamin Mullin and Michael M. Grynbaum contributed reporting.
394	When Chris Licht told his boss, Stephen Colbert, the host of the CBS program “Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” in February that he had been offered the chief executive job at CNN, Mr. Colbert was blunt: “Definitely don’t go do that.”But for Mr. Licht, nothing less than democracy itself was at stake. 
395	He argued he could make CNN a news channel that people trusted, as opposed to one that monetized partisan combat.
396	“Oh, man, you used to be in news, remember?” 
397	Mr. Colbert recalled telling him. 
398	“You said this was so much nicer — 12 weeks off, good pay, laugh for an hour every night. Everyone is really nice; you can say anything you want, and nobody leaks it. It’s great.”“CNN would be lucky to get you,” Mr. Colbert continued. 
399	“But you’re my friend, and I’m telling you not to go.”“This is a calling,” Mr. Licht countered.At which point Mr. Colbert stopped trying to dissuade him: “I can’t negotiate with a calling.”On Feb. 28, Mr. Licht was named CNN’s new chief executive. 
400	Since then, he and Mr. Colbert have spoken nearly every Friday. 
401	Each time, Mr. Colbert begins with the same four words:“I told you so.”By almost any measure, Mr. Licht, 51, has had a rough start. 
402	His first major act was to kill the network’s fledgling streaming service, CNN+, and fire 400 or so people working on it. 
403	CNN’s revenue and profits have plunged to a projected $750 million this year, down from $1.25 billion last year, partly from the costs associated with CNN+, the network acknowledged. 
404	CNN’s ratings declined, on average, this year compared with 2021, according to Nielsen, with CNN falling behind MSNBC for the first time in prime time on election night among total viewers. 
405	(CNN prevailed in the coveted 25-to-54 age group.)At the end of November, Mr. Licht levied another round of job cuts — this time just under 10 percent of CNN’s work force of about 4,000, which plunged morale further. 
406	Among the casualties were familiar commentators like Chris Cillizza, key behind-the-scenes producers with decades of experience, and the entirety of HLN, CNN’s sister network, and its popular morning host, Robin Meade.A chorus of media pundits has pounced on every tidbit of bad news. 
407	Mr. Licht’s early programming efforts aimed at repositioning the network as broader and less partisan have prompted howls of criticism, with former MSNBC host and former colleague Keith Olbermann publicly calling Mr. Licht a “TV Fascist” after he moved Don Lemon, a liberal host, from a prime-time slot to a revamped morning show.
408	“The uninformed vitriol, especially from the left, has been stunning,” Mr. Licht said in one of several interviews with The New York Times spanning his nearly eight-month tenure. 
409	“Which proves my point: so much of what passes for news is name-calling, half-truths and desperation.”Mr. 
410	Licht said he was under no illusion that stepping into the chief executive job would be easy or make him popular. 
411	The network’s previous parent, the telecommunications giant AT&T, had just spun off its Warner Media subsidiary, which included CNN, into a new company run by Discovery’s chief executive, David Zaslav.Just two months before the companies merged and only weeks before CNN+ was introduced to the world, the network’s popular and longtime chief executive, Jeff Zucker, was forced to resign after failing to disclose a romantic relationship with his top lieutenant, Allison Gollust. 
412	Some at CNN felt Mr. Zucker had been unfairly sacrificed and remained staunchly loyal to their former boss.CNN had also become the poster child for the poisoned relationship between former President Donald J. Trump and mainstream media organizations. 
413	Mr. Trump repeatedly branded CNN as “fake news,” and his administration engaged in open warfare with CNN correspondents like Jim Acosta, whom Mr. Trump once called “a rude, terrible person” during a news conference. 
414	In 2018, CNN’s New York headquarters had to be evacuated after a bomb threat.CNN remained enviably profitable, earning over $1 billion a year for the past five years. 
415	But cable news, along with all cable channels, has been in secular decline, troubled by shifting viewer habits in an era of cord cutting and an exodus to streaming services and online news sites.It’s not clear anyone could surmount those challenges, let alone someone who’d just spent nearly six years at a late-night entertainment show and had never managed a complex, globe-spanning organization with thousands of employees.So why even take the job?
416	Mr. 
417	Licht seemed to have TV news in his DNA. 
418	As a child, he’d created a fictional TV news network, WBC, and produced his own newscast using a VCR camera in his basement in Newtown, Conn. 
419	At about the age of 9, he met the NBC legal correspondent Carl Stern on a family vacation and, in Mr. Licht’s telling, “stuck to him like glue.” 
420	Mr. Licht pried the newsman’s phone number from him and used it regularly. 
421	“I was obsessed,” Mr. Licht said. 
422	After college at Syracuse University, Mr. Licht landed jobs at NBC affiliates in Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
423	As a reporter and producer, he covered a mass shooting in San Bernardino, the plane crash that killed John F. Kennedy Jr., two presidential campaigns and three Olympics.In 2005, he moved to NBC’s sibling network, MSNBC, soon becoming an executive producer for “Morning Joe,” which he helped develop into an improbable success in its hotly competitive morning time slot. 
424	Notably, the two hosts, the former Republican politician Joe Scarborough and the more liberal former CBS correspondent Mika Brzezinski, straddled the political divide. 
425	The tension between them seemed to enhance their audience appeal. 
426	Mr. Licht encouraged them to be themselves and embrace the unexpected. 
427	(They later married.)Mr.

485	Among the names tossed out have been entertainment, comedy and sports figures. 
486	He declined to be more specific but promised surprises.Miklos Sarvary, a professor and director of the media and technology program at Columbia Business School, said that entertainment was potentially more profitable than low-margin news. 
487	“But what does that do to the brand if you want to be the most trusted name in news?” he said. 
488	“News is supposed to be serious. I’m not sure that putting on a comedian is a great move for credibility.”Mr. 
489	Licht said he understood Mr. Sarvary’s point, but said prime time offered “some leeway for being a little different.”“It has to be compelling and entertaining without hurting the news brand,” he said, citing his former boss Mr. Colbert, and Mr. Stewart as “the kind of people who’d work,” while acknowledging that Mr. Stewart is already locked into a lucrative contract at Apple TV.Every Saturday, Mr. Licht sends Mr. Zaslav a memo with highlights of the week and programming and financial updates. 
490	Mr. Licht’s growth strategy is focused on CNN.com, which attracts more than 200 million unique visitors each month, according to CNN. 
491	But at its peak, CNN digital generated only about 10 percent of the network’s profits, Mr. Licht confirmed.On Oct. 13, Mr. Licht made his debut in front of Warner Brother Discovery’s board at a hotel in Los Angeles, where he outlined both his growth and content strategy. 
492	Asked about his efforts to make CNN less partisan, Mr. Licht gave this analogy: Suppose it’s raining outside. 
493	CNN plans to have people on who love the rain, and it will have people on who say they don’t like the rain. 
494	But it won’t have anyone on who says it’s sunny out.Mr. 
495	Licht said he used the analogy to make clear that a less-partisan CNN did not mean it was any less committed to truth. 
496	“This wasn’t to plot a new course but to assure people we would not let up one inch in being truth tellers,” he said. 
497	“The change is we will not do Trump 24/7 or let him dictate our agenda.”By all accounts, Mr. Licht’s presentation was warmly received by directors, including Mr. Malone.Mr. 
498	Licht’s vision is contending with industrywide pressures to cut costs. 
499	(He said he appreciates but doesn’t really believe Mr. Zaslav’s professed indifference to financial results.) 
500	By announcing the need for more layoffs on Oct. 26, he said he hoped to engage in a “transparent” process that would leave everyone feeling they’d been heard. 
501	But, he said, “it would be irresponsible not to do the tough work now.” 
502	He added, “I promise you CNN will be more profitable next year.”However transparent, many in CNN’s rank and file felt blindsided by the cuts, especially after what they perceived as his earlier reassurances that no further layoffs would be needed. 
503	In a all-staff meeting in November, Mr. Licht said he stood by his earlier remark that there would be no merger-related layoffs, and “I absolutely would not have said something that I did not believe to be true.” 
504	But he said he understood how his remarks had hurt his credibility. 
505	“I have to win that credibility back,” he acknowledged.Mr. 
506	Licht said the firings were the “low point” of his tenure so far.At another all-staff meeting this month, aimed at restoring morale, Mr. Licht took questions and then ended with a passage he wrote himself:In terms of morale, let me just say, you work at a world-renowned news organization alongside the best journalists on the globe. 
507	Your jobs have meaning. 
508	Your jobs have an impact. 
509	You are part of something bigger, of something with tremendous meaning. 
510	And nothing about that has changed. 
511	And you have in me as a leader, who has done a lot of your jobs, someone who has your back every step of the way. 
512	My loyalty is first and foremost to this organization and to journalism without fear or favor to anyone else, including our parent company.That’s why I’m here. 
513	That’s why I took this job.
514	“I want CNN to be essential to society,” Mr. Licht said in one of our interviews. 
515	“If you’re essential then the revenue will follow.”And if it doesn’t?
516	“Maybe it won’t work,” Mr. Licht conceded. 
517	“But I’d rather try to win this way.”Benjamin Mullin and Michael M. Grynbaum contributed reporting.
518	ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. — The referee warned the Buffalo Bills fans inside Highmark Stadium as if he were a teacher scolding schoolchildren at recess.If their flying snowballs hit a Miami Dolphins player during live action, the referee said, the Bills would be penalized 15 yards. 
519	Security guards in neon yellow jackets had already migrated toward the Miami bench to dissuade fans from pelting the players and coaches there. 
520	The large video monitor over the end zone also repeated the message.
521	“That was great,” Bills safety Jordan Poyer said in a postgame news conference Saturday. 
522	“That was the first time I had ever heard that.”The intensity of the Bills fans highlighted the increased stakes of the contest, as the divisional rivals jockeyed for playoff seeding in the loaded A.F.C. The Bills won the game, 32-29, clinching a playoff berth and edging closer toward home-field advantage throughout the postseason. 
523	It is the fifth time in Coach Sean McDermott’s six seasons at Buffalo that the team has reached the playoffs. 
524	The Bills have been regarded by sports books and pundits as Super Bowl favorites.
525	“It’s humbling,” McDermott said. 
526	“It really is. That’s how I feel about it. I’m humbled to be a part of it in this great town that doesn’t get as much credit as it deserves.”A 25-yard field goal by Buffalo’s Tyler Bass ended a back-and forth affair between two of the league’s best offenses. 
527	The Bills marched 86 yards in the game’s closing six minutes to break a 29-29 tie. 
528	With 50 seconds remaining in the game, Miami defensive back Kader Kohou was called for a pass interference penalty against Bills receiver Isaiah McKenzie, bringing the ball to the Dolphins’ 13-yard line. 
529	That set the Bills up in prime field position for an easy kick to win the game.Bills quarterback Josh Allen completed 25 of 40 passes for 304 yards and four touchdowns, while Miami’s Tua Tagovailoa completed 17 of 30 passes for 234 yards and two scores. 
530	Allen also added 77 rushing yards on 10 carries, helping to avenge the 21-19 loss the Bills suffered to the Dolphins in September.The game was played in temperatures as low as 27 degrees Fahrenheit. 
531	Though snow flurries hit the area earlier in the day, a snowstorm projected to affect the game at halftime stood at bay until the middle of the fourth quarter. 
532	By the final whistle, the field, which was once clear, was sodded with a sheet of fresh snow. 
533	(The fans had, ahem, laid a little bit of the groundwork with their snowballs early in the game.)All week, the Dolphins tried to downplay the potential impact of the frigid conditions. 
534	Miami Coach Mike McDaniel on Wednesday wore a T-shirt that read, “I Wish It Were Colder.” 
535	The team practiced on the indoor fields at its training facility in Miami Gardens, Fla., with the air-conditioning turned up. 
536	Linebacker Jaelan Phillips and cornerback Noah Igbinoghene participated in pregame warm-ups on Saturday shirtless with their bare chests exposed to the chill.McDaniel told reporters he did not believe the elements affected the Dolphins’ performance in the loss, their third straight.
537	“I know a lot of people would like to make it about the weather, but our team never did,” McDaniel said. 
538	“It was cool for you guys to talk about, but it was more about the football.”The Bills led at halftime, 21-13, after Allen fired a 4-yard touchdown pass to James Cook as time expired in the second quarter. 
539	The Bills allowed only one touchdown to the Dolphins in the first half — an 11-yard run by Salvon Ahmed — despite Miami entering the red zone three times. 
540	Allen threw three touchdowns before halftime as the Dolphins’ defense struggled to contain him and his receivers while he scrambled. 
541	Allen also was not sacked in the first half.Then the Bills got sloppy. 
542	Buffalo converted none of its four third-down attempts in the third quarter, sputtering after an explosive first half. 
543	But the Dolphins, who entered Saturday with the league’s ninth-best scoring offense, scored two touchdowns in the period: Tagovailoa connected with Jaylen Waddle for a 67-yard touchdown and with the speedy Tyreek Hill for a 20-yard score. 
544	The Bills finished the quarter down, 26-21.“You’re going to have ups and downs in every game,” Bills tight end Dawson Knox said. 
545	“There’s going to be those lulls. The best teams find ways to push through that. They find ways to win, whether it’s by 1 or 100.”Miami stretched its lead in the fourth after Phillips strip-sacked Allen and the Dolphins recovered the ball. 
546	Five plays later, their lead widened to 29-21 with 11:56 remaining in the game after a 47-yard field goal. 
547	Allen was sacked twice in the second half as offensive line protection wore down and Miami’s pass rush began penetrating the backfield more often.But the Bills clawed back. 
548	Allen threw a five-yard touchdown pass to Knox with about nine minutes remaining the fourth quarter. 
549	Allen then dove over the end zone for the two-point conversion, which officials ruled as successful after a lengthy review, tying the game at 29. 
550	The Dolphins spent the next three minutes trying to score, but ended up punting, paving the way for Buffalo’s game-winning drive.Since the off-season, after the Bills added linebacker Von Miller to an already-stout roster, Super Bowl expectations have grown immensely for the Bills. 
551	They started 6-1 before losing back-to-back games to the Jets and Minnesota Vikings. 
552	Both of those contests were decided by three points, and ended in Bills losses partly because of sloppy play and turnovers in the second half.The Bills have since won five straight games, becoming one of the most complete teams in the league. 
553	Entering Saturday, the offense ranked second in yards, and the defense ranked second in points allowed even after Miller injured his knee against the Detroit Lions on Thanksgiving. 
554	But despite their lofty aspirations, Allen said he does not want to think too far ahead.
555	“Can’t win the Super Bowl unless you make the playoffs,” Allen said. 
556	“That’s goal No. 1 down. Goal No. 2 is to clinch the division. That’s how we’ll take it, one game at a time.”
557	A well-known Catholic priest and incendiary leader of the anti-abortion movement was removed from the priesthood by the Vatican, according to a letter from Pope Francis’ representative to the United States that was obtained by The New York Times.Frank Pavone, who leads the advocacy organization Priests for Life, and was once a religious adviser to former President Donald J. Trump, was dismissed from the clergy on Nov. 9 with no possibility of appeal, the letter states. 
558	The letter included a statement about the removal, called laicization, that it said was approved by the Dicastery for the Clergy, a Vatican office.
559	“This action was taken after Father Pavone was found guilty in canonical proceedings of blasphemous communications on social media, and of persistent disobedience of the lawful instructions of his diocesan bishop,” it states.The letter did not specify those communications or disobedience, or name the diocesan bishop.  
560	Reached by phone on Sunday morning, Mr. Pavone said that he had not been properly notified of the decision.
561	“I’m waiting for them to point out to me what I did wrong that merits something like this,” he said. 
562	And though the Vatican has said there was no possibility of appeal, Mr. Pavone said that ultimately he and his allies “would have to appeal to the next pope” and “to the people of God.”The punishment of a high-profile Catholic anti-abortion activist comes at a precarious moment for the movement as it plans its future after losses in the midterm election and struggles to unify Republicans around the issue. 
563	Mr. Pavone’s anti-abortion activism was not cited in the letter as the reason for his dismissal.The move also comes a month after the Catholic bishops of the United States said they would redouble their efforts to end abortion and elected new leaders who are expected to continue the conservative leanings of the hierarchy.Mr. 
564	Pavone, a ubiquitous figure at anti-abortion rallies and fund-raisers, is prolific on social media. 
565	By his own account, his outspoken anti-abortion activism has won the support of some church leaders over the years but has also led to clashes with others.He is also known in the anti-abortion movement for his relationship with Norma McCorvey, the ‘Jane Roe’ of Roe v. Wade, whose lawsuit led to the U.S. Supreme Court decision nearly 50 years ago to enshrine the right to abortion in the Constitution. 
566	Ms. McCorvey later converted to Catholicism and the anti-abortion cause, at least for a time. 
567	The court rescinded the right this summer.Mr. 
568	Pavone was devoted to Mr. Trump and was among those who questioned the results of the 2020 election.His dismissal was first reported by the conservative outlet Catholic News Agency on Saturday night.On a live broadcast on social media shortly after the report, Mr. Pavone said he had received no communication from the Vatican about his removal. 
569	Wearing a leather jacket over his priest’s collar, he said he would continue his work for the anti-abortion cause.
570	“I’ve been persecuted in the church for decades, decades. This is nothing new for me,” he said. 
571	“They just don’t like the work I’m doing for these babies.”He seemed to refer to a comment on Twitter from 2020 in which he referred to “supporters of this goddamn loser Biden and his morally corrupt, America-hating, God hating Democrat party.”“I used the word G-D in a response to somebody in a tweet and for that they want to throw me out of the priesthood,” he said.The letter about his removal makes no specific reference to this incident, or to abortion beyond his affiliation.Online, Mr. Pavone seemed to compare his removal itself to abortion.
572	“In every profession, including the priesthood, if you defend the #unborn, you will be treated like them!” he wrote on Twitter on Saturday night. 
573	“The only difference is that when we are ‘aborted,’ we continue to speak, loud and clear.”Archbishop Christophe Pierre, the Pope’s representative to the United States, called the apostolic nuncio, addressed the letter dated Dec. 13 to bishops, alerting them of the decision from the Vatican. 
574	The New York Times obtained the letter from a person who had access to it but who was not authorized to share it.
575	“As you will know, Father Pavone was a very public and high profile figure associated with the Right to Life Movement in the U.S.,” Archbishop Pierre states. 
576	“His dismissal from the clerical state may, therefore, be a matter of interest among the faithful. In anticipation of that potential interest, the attached statement regarding Father Pavone is provided for your information.”The statement said that Mr. Pavone was given “ample opportunity to defend himself” as well as “multiple opportunities to submit himself to the authority of his diocesan bishop.”“It was determined that Father Pavone had no reasonable justification for his actions,” it says.The statement said the future of Mr. Pavone’s role at Priests for Life would be entirely up to the group, which it described as “not a Catholic organization.”In his broadcast, Mr. Pavone said, “You can’t cancel this message, you won’t silence this message. It’s only going to grow. We’re only going to get louder.”During the 2016 presidential election, Mr. Pavone posted a live video on Facebook in which he put an aborted fetus on what appeared to be an altar. 
577	The Diocese of Amarillo in Texas, which oversaw him at the time, announced that it opened an investigation into Mr. Pavone as a result. 
578	The diocese did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday night.Mr. 
579	Pavone clashed publicly with the bishop of the Diocese of Amarillo, Patrick Zurek, several times over the years. 
580	In the fall of 2020, the diocese issued a statement saying Catholics should disregard Mr. Pavone’s rhetoric about the election, including comments online about withholding the absolution of sin from Catholics who voted Democratic.
581	“These postings are not consistent with Catholic Church Teachings,” the diocese said in a statement at the time. 
582	“Please disregard them and pray for Father Pavone.”In the interview on Sunday, Mr. Pavone said that he believed the removal process stemmed from the Amarillo investigation. 
583	He said that he had previously told church authorities he would not participate in the process, which he saw as “tainted.” 
584	Following the report of his dismissal, Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, defended Mr. Pavone as “the one priest devoted most over the years” to taking action and building support for the anti-abortion cause, and said that she would continue to lean on him going forward.
585	“He and I see it the same way: This is the very beginning of the pro-life movement, and he has only just gotten started,” she said. 
586	Eric Scheidler, the executive director of the Pro-Life Action League, which has a long relationship with Mr. Pavone, said it was “hard to see an organization called Priests for Life headed by a man who’s not recognized as a priest by any local bishop.”Mr. 
587	Pavone’s removal could rattle his fellow activists at a sensitive time, said Mr. Scheidler, who is Catholic.
588	“It’s a time of real soul-searching and challenges for the pro-life movement as we try to rebuild after the backlash to the overturning of Roe v. Wade,” he said.
589	When Chris Licht told his boss, Stephen Colbert, the host of the CBS program “Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” in February that he had been offered the chief executive job at CNN, Mr. Colbert was blunt: “Definitely don’t go do that.”But for Mr. Licht, nothing less than democracy itself was at stake. 
590	He argued he could make CNN a news channel that people trusted, as opposed to one that monetized partisan combat.
591	“Oh, man, you used to be in news, remember?” 
592	Mr. Colbert recalled telling him. 
593	“You said this was so much nicer — 12 weeks off, good pay, laugh for an hour every night. Everyone is really nice; you can say anything you want, and nobody leaks it. It’s great.”“CNN would be lucky to get you,” Mr. Colbert continued. 
594	“But you’re my friend, and I’m telling you not to go.”“This is a calling,” Mr. Licht countered.At which point Mr. Colbert stopped trying to dissuade him: “I can’t negotiate with a calling.”On Feb. 28, Mr. Licht was named CNN’s new chief executive. 
595	Since then, he and Mr. Colbert have spoken nearly every Friday. 
596	Each time, Mr. Colbert begins with the same four words:“I told you so.”By almost any measure, Mr. Licht, 51, has had a rough start. 
597	His first major act was to kill the network’s fledgling streaming service, CNN+, and fire 400 or so people working on it. 
598	CNN’s revenue and profits have plunged to a projected $750 million this year, down from $1.25 billion last year, partly from the costs associated with CNN+, the network acknowledged. 
599	CNN’s ratings declined, on average, this year compared with 2021, according to Nielsen, with CNN falling behind MSNBC for the first time in prime time on election night among total viewers. 
600	(CNN prevailed in the coveted 25-to-54 age group.)At the end of November, Mr. Licht levied another round of job cuts — this time just under 10 percent of CNN’s work force of about 4,000, which plunged morale further. 
601	Among the casualties were familiar commentators like Chris Cillizza, key behind-the-scenes producers with decades of experience, and the entirety of HLN, CNN’s sister network, and its popular morning host, Robin Meade.A chorus of media pundits has pounced on every tidbit of bad news. 
602	Mr. Licht’s early programming efforts aimed at repositioning the network as broader and less partisan have prompted howls of criticism, with former MSNBC host and former colleague Keith Olbermann publicly calling Mr. Licht a “TV Fascist” after he moved Don Lemon, a liberal host, from a prime-time slot to a revamped morning show.
603	“The uninformed vitriol, especially from the left, has been stunning,” Mr. Licht said in one of several interviews with The New York Times spanning his nearly eight-month tenure. 
604	“Which proves my point: so much of what passes for news is name-calling, half-truths and desperation.”Mr. 
605	Licht said he was under no illusion that stepping into the chief executive job would be easy or make him popular. 
606	The network’s previous parent, the telecommunications giant AT&T, had just spun off its Warner Media subsidiary, which included CNN, into a new company run by Discovery’s chief executive, David Zaslav.Just two months before the companies merged and only weeks before CNN+ was introduced to the world, the network’s popular and longtime chief executive, Jeff Zucker, was forced to resign after failing to disclose a romantic relationship with his top lieutenant, Allison Gollust. 
607	Some at CNN felt Mr. Zucker had been unfairly sacrificed and remained staunchly loyal to their former boss.CNN had also become the poster child for the poisoned relationship between former President Donald J. Trump and mainstream media organizations. 
608	Mr. Trump repeatedly branded CNN as “fake news,” and his administration engaged in open warfare with CNN correspondents like Jim Acosta, whom Mr. Trump once called “a rude, terrible person” during a news conference. 
609	In 2018, CNN’s New York headquarters had to be evacuated after a bomb threat.CNN remained enviably profitable, earning over $1 billion a year for the past five years. 
610	But cable news, along with all cable channels, has been in secular decline, troubled by shifting viewer habits in an era of cord cutting and an exodus to streaming services and online news sites.It’s not clear anyone could surmount those challenges, let alone someone who’d just spent nearly six years at a late-night entertainment show and had never managed a complex, globe-spanning organization with thousands of employees.So why even take the job?
611	Mr. 
612	Licht seemed to have TV news in his DNA. 
613	As a child, he’d created a fictional TV news network, WBC, and produced his own newscast using a VCR camera in his basement in Newtown, Conn. 
614	At about the age of 9, he met the NBC legal correspondent Carl Stern on a family vacation and, in Mr. Licht’s telling, “stuck to him like glue.” 
615	Mr. Licht pried the newsman’s phone number from him and used it regularly. 
616	“I was obsessed,” Mr. Licht said. 
617	After college at Syracuse University, Mr. Licht landed jobs at NBC affiliates in Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
618	As a reporter and producer, he covered a mass shooting in San Bernardino, the plane crash that killed John F. Kennedy Jr., two presidential campaigns and three Olympics.In 2005, he moved to NBC’s sibling network, MSNBC, soon becoming an executive producer for “Morning Joe,” which he helped develop into an improbable success in its hotly competitive morning time slot. 
619	Notably, the two hosts, the former Republican politician Joe Scarborough and the more liberal former CBS correspondent Mika Brzezinski, straddled the political divide. 
620	The tension between them seemed to enhance their audience appeal. 
621	Mr. Licht encouraged them to be themselves and embrace the unexpected. 
622	(They later married.)Mr. 
623	Licht moved to CBS in 2010, where he’d scored another early morning success. 
624	He lifted ratings at the perennial also-ran “CBS This Morning” on the strength of the program’s three hosts, Charlie Rose, Gayle King and Norah O’Donnell, and an emphasis on news and in-depth interviews, rather than the lighter fare format of its competitors “Today” and “Good Morning America.”After having a brain aneurysm in 2010 when he was still under 40, Mr. Licht wrote a book about what he learned from the experience, while still describing himself as a “killer TV producer” with “no urge to surrender my spot in the fast lane,” even after the near-fatal incident.Restless after six years at “This Morning,” in 2016 he joined the then-faltering CBS program “Late Show With Stephen Colbert.” 
625	Within a year, Mr. Colbert had seized the late-night ratings crown from Jimmy Fallon of NBC’s “Tonight Show.”Soon after the Warner-Discovery deal was announced, Mr. Zaslav summoned Mr. Licht to Discovery’s headquarters in Manhattan on 19th Street and asked what he thought of CNN.Mr. 
626	Licht told him he had no interest in running it. 
627	“I got out of news, and I’m not going back,” Mr. Licht had insisted.Mr. 
628	Zaslav ignored the demurral. 
629	Over the next several weeks, he kept making the case to Mr. Licht. 
630	In fact, Mr. Zaslav said in an interview that he never considered anyone else for the job.The two men have known each other for 15 years, since both were working at NBC, where Mr. Zaslav helped start MSNBC. 
631	In the years since, they have had breakfast once a quarter. 
632	Mr. Licht has looked to Mr. Zaslav as a mentor, and Mr. Zaslav has admired Mr. Licht’s work ethic and drive.
633	“He’s a fighter, and he likes to win,” Mr. Zaslav said.At their first meeting, Mr. Zaslav argued that running CNN would be “a great opportunity to build the No. 1 news brand in the world,” and “the most trusted brand in news where people go every day and in a crisis for the best version of the truth.”And more than that: “This is important for America. It’s important for a functioning society.”Mr. 
634	Licht and Mr. Zaslav — not to mention Warner’s largest shareholder, the media mogul John Malone — were philosophically aligned. 
635	Fox and MSNBC were “advocacy” networks, as Mr. Zaslav put it, a proven business model appealing to like-minded viewers but of scant, if any, value as a public service. 
636	Whether by design or happenstance, he believed CNN had tacked left, a pale version of MSNBC that nonetheless alienated wide parts of the American electorate with a focus on politics and the president at the time, Mr. Trump.Ted Turner’s mantra had always been “the news is the star.” 
637	Mr. Trump “is not the star,” Mr. Zaslav said.Yet Mr. Licht was noncommittal. 
638	On a subsequent phone call, Mr. Zaslav urged Mr. Licht to think about CNN and whether he’d be interested in the top job. 
639	After Mr. Licht hung up, his wife, Jennifer Blanco Licht, a former TV executive herself, asked: “Is this crazy? I think you should do it.”The two men continued the conversation on a long walk in Central Park. 
640	(They both live near the park.) 
641	During that conversation, Mr. Zaslav warned Mr. Licht that he’d be closely scrutinized and judged harshly. 
642	Is your family ready for this? 
643	Are you ready for this? 
644	Because “it will be brutal,” Mr. Zaslav said.Mr. 
645	Licht said he doesn’t recall Mr. Zaslav ever offering him the job, or his accepting it. 
646	At one point, Mr. Zaslav simply asked, “Who’s your lawyer?” and started acting like Mr. Licht was CNN’s future chief executive. 
647	A contract ensued.On their first lunch afterward, at Mr. Zaslav’s usual corner table at Gramercy Tavern, Mr. Zaslav indicated their yearslong relationship had fundamentally changed. 
648	“We’ve been friends for 15 years,” Mr. Zaslav said. 
649	“We’re not friends any more. You work for me.”Almost immediately, their shared vision of saving democracy ran into the harsh reality of cable news economics.With Fox News and MSNBC having already staked out the right and left ends of the political spectrum, attracting the middle (what Mr. Licht referred to as “normal” people) has proved elusive. 
650	Mr. Zaslav had stressed that he didn’t care — at least not much — about CNN’s current ratings, revenue or profitability. 
651	He recognized that it would take years to reposition and rebuild the network. 
652	But even he had his limits.AT&T’s board had approved an ambitious budget of $350 million for CNN+, much of it already spent by the time Mr. Licht arrived. 
653	Many more millions would be needed. 
654	With Warner facing pressure from Wall Street to find $3 billion in savings, on April 21, Mr. Licht killed the streaming service after less than a month on air.In an effort to restore morale and calm anxiety, Mr. Licht assured CNN employees at a network-wide town hall meeting on May 5 that Warner Bros. 
655	Discovery didn’t anticipate further job cuts at CNN because there was no overlap between the news network and Discovery’s cable channels, and thus there wasn’t anyone else doing the same jobs that would need to be cut. 
656	In a series of additional town hall meetings, most of them leaked almost immediately to The New York Times and other news outlets, Mr. Licht also laid the groundwork for the network’s shift to broader, less political and less partisan coverage. 
657	This was not, he stressed repeatedly, a move to the “center,” a boring, political neutral zone that Mr. Licht wasn’t even sure existed. 
658	Rather, it was an attempt to explore controversial issues from varied perspectives — not to tell people “what to think,” as he put it, but “how to think,” or what he called a “blueprint for how to make decisions.”In July, Mr. Licht made a highly symbolic pilgrimage to Capitol Hill noteworthy for its inclusion of Republicans like the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, and Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas. 
659	Although he spent equal time with Democratic leaders like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Mr. Licht was irritated that his visit was billed as an “apology tour” and effort to coax Republicans back onto the network — part of CNN’s perceived move to the right.After long absences, several Republicans have since appeared on CNN, including Mr. McCarthy and Senator Rick Scott of Florida.Featuring hosts and guests with opposing points of view and playing up controversy has paid ratings dividends on cable in the past, notably on CNN’s own “Crossfire,” which came under criticism for evolving into to a verbal food fight criticized by the comedian Jon Stewart as “hurting America.”But Mr. Licht said he wasn’t interested in controversy for its own sake, but to offer a “rational conversation about polarizing issues.” 
660	After watching CNN, he hopes people will “take what they’ve heard to the dinner table and have a discussion,” he said. 
661	“That’s a dream of mine.”Two examples have been coverage of the abortion debate in the wake of the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade, and the debate over gun rights. 
662	To vocal criticism from the left, he hired Stephen Gutowski, founder and editor of The Reload, a firearms website. 
663	No one wants a school shooting, said Mr. Licht, whose hometown, Newtown, was the site of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre. 
664	“But we have to understand the culture of people who like guns,” he said.
665	“This is not vanilla, centrist or boring,” he added.Mr. 
666	Licht has barely begun to put his stamp on the network’s programming, but it’s already evident in the new morning show, “CNN This Morning.” 
667	Mr. Licht picked the hosts, persuading the left-leaning Don Lemon to trade his prime-time slot for early morning, and pairing him with the former Daily Caller reporter and CNN White House correspondent Kaitlan Collins and Poppy Harlow, a former host of “CNN Newsroom.” 
668	The show takes a somewhat similar approach to the one he used at “CBS This Morning” (which also shares a near-identical name).
669	In a series of interviews with The Times, Mr. Licht visibly came to life talking about “This Morning” and its co-hosts. 
670	“They obviously like each other,” he said. 
671	“The chemistry is great. I love the collaboration. Every day, it evolves. It’s not like me giving orders. It’s so much fun.”“This Morning” debuted on Nov. 1. 
672	The New York Post (which shares ownership with CNN’s rival, Fox News) reported the next day that “‘CNN This Morning’ bombs in debut,” drawing just 387,000 viewers, far behind rival morning shows and trailing its predecessor on CNN, “New Day.” 
673	CNN called the instant critique “absurd and cheap” after just one day’s data. 
674	(Since then, the show has gained slightly among total viewers.) 
675	More significantly, Mr. Licht noted, “This Morning” has broken news, including the chief Washington correspondent Jake Tapper’s scoop that Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona was leaving the Democratic Party to become an Independent.Prime time looms as an even greater challenge. 
676	In August, Mr. Licht moved Mr. Tapper from his 4 p.m. anchor position to the coveted 9 p.m. slot that had been vacated by Chris Cuomo after CNN fired him for what it deemed inappropriate efforts to help his brother, New York’s former governor, Andrew Cuomo, fend off the sexual harassment allegations that led to his resignation from office. 
677	The experiment with Mr. Tapper fared poorly in the ratings and lasted just one month.Mr. 
678	Licht acknowledged that prime time remains an “open canvas.” 
679	He said he and his colleagues were meeting and “throwing things against the wall, looking at off-the-beaten path opportunities.” 
680	Among the names tossed out have been entertainment, comedy and sports figures. 
681	He declined to be more specific but promised surprises.Miklos Sarvary, a professor and director of the media and technology program at Columbia Business School, said that entertainment was potentially more profitable than low-margin news. 
682	“But what does that do to the brand if you want to be the most trusted name in news?” he said. 
683	“News is supposed to be serious. I’m not sure that putting on a comedian is a great move for credibility.”Mr. 
684	Licht said he understood Mr. Sarvary’s point, but said prime time offered “some leeway for being a little different.”“It has to be compelling and entertaining without hurting the news brand,” he said, citing his former boss Mr. Colbert, and Mr. Stewart as “the kind of people who’d work,” while acknowledging that Mr. Stewart is already locked into a lucrative contract at Apple TV.Every Saturday, Mr. Licht sends Mr. Zaslav a memo with highlights of the week and programming and financial updates. 
685	Mr. Licht’s growth strategy is focused on CNN.com, which attracts more than 200 million unique visitors each month, according to CNN. 
686	But at its peak, CNN digital generated only about 10 percent of the network’s profits, Mr. Licht confirmed.On Oct. 13, Mr. Licht made his debut in front of Warner Brother Discovery’s board at a hotel in Los Angeles, where he outlined both his growth and content strategy. 
687	Asked about his efforts to make CNN less partisan, Mr. Licht gave this analogy: Suppose it’s raining outside. 
688	CNN plans to have people on who love the rain, and it will have people on who say they don’t like the rain. 
689	But it won’t have anyone on who says it’s sunny out.Mr. 
690	Licht said he used the analogy to make clear that a less-partisan CNN did not mean it was any less committed to truth. 
691	“This wasn’t to plot a new course but to assure people we would not let up one inch in being truth tellers,” he said. 
692	“The change is we will not do Trump 24/7 or let him dictate our agenda.”By all accounts, Mr. Licht’s presentation was warmly received by directors, including Mr. Malone.Mr. 
693	Licht’s vision is contending with industrywide pressures to cut costs. 
694	(He said he appreciates but doesn’t really believe Mr. Zaslav’s professed indifference to financial results.) 
695	By announcing the need for more layoffs on Oct. 26, he said he hoped to engage in a “transparent” process that would leave everyone feeling they’d been heard. 
696	But, he said, “it would be irresponsible not to do the tough work now.” 
697	He added, “I promise you CNN will be more profitable next year.”However transparent, many in CNN’s rank and file felt blindsided by the cuts, especially after what they perceived as his earlier reassurances that no further layoffs would be needed. 
698	In a all-staff meeting in November, Mr. Licht said he stood by his earlier remark that there would be no merger-related layoffs, and “I absolutely would not have said something that I did not believe to be true.” 
699	But he said he understood how his remarks had hurt his credibility. 
700	“I have to win that credibility back,” he acknowledged.Mr. 
701	Licht said the firings were the “low point” of his tenure so far.At another all-staff meeting this month, aimed at restoring morale, Mr. Licht took questions and then ended with a passage he wrote himself:In terms of morale, let me just say, you work at a world-renowned news organization alongside the best journalists on the globe. 
702	Your jobs have meaning. 
703	Your jobs have an impact. 
704	You are part of something bigger, of something with tremendous meaning. 
705	And nothing about that has changed. 
706	And you have in me as a leader, who has done a lot of your jobs, someone who has your back every step of the way. 
707	My loyalty is first and foremost to this organization and to journalism without fear or favor to anyone else, including our parent company.That’s why I’m here. 
708	That’s why I took this job.
709	“I want CNN to be essential to society,” Mr. Licht said in one of our interviews. 
710	“If you’re essential then the revenue will follow.”And if it doesn’t?
711	“Maybe it won’t work,” Mr. Licht conceded. 
712	“But I’d rather try to win this way.”Benjamin Mullin and Michael M. Grynbaum contributed reporting.
713	On the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, as scores of Proud Boys were getting ready to take their place in a pro-Trump mob outside the Capitol, a leader of the far-right group sent a message to his colleagues.
714	“I want to see thousands of normies burn that city to ash today,” he wrote.Almost two years later, the notion that the Proud Boys wanted to provoke violence among the “normies” — or the normal people — in the crowd that day rests at the heart of the government’s case against five members of the group who are facing trial on charges of seditious conspiracy in connection with the Capitol attack.At the trial, which begins with jury selection on Monday, prosecutors intend to argue that the five defendants turned the mob into a weapon on Jan. 6 and pointed it at the Capitol, where lawmakers had gathered to certify the results of the 2020 election, according to court papers and pretrial hearings. 
715	It was all part of a plot, the government will say, to stop the lawful transfer of power and ensure that President Donald J. Trump remained in office.The Proud Boys trial is opening in Federal District Court in Washington less than a month after Stewart Rhodes, the leader of another far-right group, the Oath Keepers militia, was convicted along with one of his lieutenants of seditious conspiracy at a separate trial in the same courthouse, which sits within sight of the domed Capitol building.While prosecutors could have taken the five Proud Boys to trial on relatively simple charges like trespassing or interfering with law enforcement officers, they instead aimed higher and charged sedition, which carries a hefty 20-year maximum sentence and has much more serious political connotations. 
716	But by doing so, the government has assumed the burden of proving that the defendants plotted in advance of Jan. 6 to use force to oppose the authority of the U.S. government or to interfere with the execution of federal laws — in this case, those that govern the transfer of presidential power.Much as in Mr. Rhodes’s trial, the government’s presentation in the Proud Boys trial will seek to bolster its sedition charges with thousands of internal text messages seized by the government and insider testimony from cooperating witnesses. 
717	But the differences between the two proceedings may be more instructive than their similarities.For one thing, prosecutors never accused Mr. Rhodes and his four co-defendants of personally committing serious acts of violence at the Capitol. 
718	Instead, they proved that the Oath Keepers plotted to use force against the government by pointing out that the group persistently said a civil war might be needed to fight the administration of Joseph R. Biden Jr. and that on Jan. 6 it stashed an arsenal of high-powered weapons in hotel rooms in Virginia.But in trying the Proud Boys, prosecutors plan to take a different tack: They will offer the jury a detailed account of how the five defendants — including Enrique Tarrio, the group’s former chairman — led their own troops and other “tools” in the mob into battle at the Capitol and played a central role in breaches of the building and in hand-to-hand fights with the police.Founded in 2016 during Mr. Trump’s first run for office, the Proud Boys have long described themselves as “Western chauvinists” out to protect American politics from the supposedly corrosive effects of modern liberal culture.But something else has always simmered beneath that public guise: a toxic stew of male grievance, misogyny, Islamophobia and anti-gay hatred, as well as a veneration of violence that has often boiled over into brawling in the streets.The government plans to tell some of that history at the trial and to demonstrate how the Proud Boys, under Mr. Tarrio’s leadership, became involved in pro-Trump rallies in Washington after the election. 
719	At one of those events, on Dec. 12, 2020, Mr. Tarrio burned a Black Lives Matter banner that had been hanging at a local Black church; other members of the group clashed with leftist counterprotesters, resulting in a Proud Boys leader, Jeremy Bertino, getting stabbed.A lingering effect of that incident, prosecutors plan to argue, is that it turned the Proud Boys against the police after years of having troublingly close relationships with officers across the country. 
720	The government wants to show the jury how the group became disillusioned with law enforcement to explain the events of Jan. 6, when members of the Proud Boys took the lead in assaulting the police.One week after the December rally, Mr. Trump posted a message on Twitter that announced another protest — which he said would be “wild” — in Washington on Jan. 6. 
721	Prosecutors will try to show that the Proud Boys heard the message as a clarion call and sprang into action.Working with a group of his top lieutenants, prosecutors say, Mr. Tarrio put together a handpicked crew of “rally boys” who would take the lead in the Proud Boys’ efforts on Jan. 6. 
722	The rank-and-file members of the group, Mr. Tarrio later said, would work in 10-man teams that day with medics and communications experts.Mr. 
723	Tarrio was not at the Capitol on Jan. 6, having been kicked out of Washington by a local judge after he returned to the city two days earlier and was arrested over the banner-burning incident and for carrying two high-capacity firearm magazines.But prosecutors plan to argue to the jury that three of his co-defendants — Joseph Biggs of Ormond Beach, Fla.
724	; Ethan Nordean of Auburn, Wash.
725	; and Zachary Rehl of Philadelphia — took the lead on the ground that day. 
726	A fourth co-defendant — Dominic Pezzola of Rochester, N.Y. — is best known for having broken one of the first windows at the Capitol with a stolen police riot shield.As part of the government’s case, jurors are also likely to hear from several former Proud Boys who have since pleaded guilty, including two from North Carolina: Mr. Bertino and Charles Donohoe. 
727	The government may also seek to introduce evidence about a document called “1776 Returns” that was given to Mr. Tarrio by one of his girlfriends and detailed a plan to surveil and storm several government buildings around the Capitol on Jan. 6.Recent court filings suggest that the lawyers for the Proud Boys intend to mount a robust defense. 
728	Echoing the lawyers in the Oath Keepers case, their central argument will be to claim that while the defendants breached the Capitol building, they did not plan the attack in any way that rose to the level of seditious conspiracy.Indeed, the lawyers have claimed in court papers that many of the government’s own witnesses have provided statements to prosecutors contradicting the assertion that the Proud Boys had any sort of plan to assault the Capitol. 
729	The lawyers have also maintained that the F.B.I. had as many as eight informants in the group before Jan. 6 and that none of them reported back about an intent to storm the building, raising questions, as one lawyer wrote, about “whether a Proud Boy conspiracy plan” to commit sedition “ever existed or could have existed.”In a more general sense, the defense will seek to persuade the jury that the Proud Boys are not racist brawlers, as they are often portrayed by the media, but more like what the founder of the group, Gavin McInnes, has long described them as: a patriotic men’s drinking club. 
730	At one point, the lawyers had thought they might call Mr. McInnes as a witness for the defense, but that remains unclear.Still, the jury is likely to get a glimpse of Proud Boys culture as the lawyers relate how dozens of members of the group descended on Washington to support Mr. Trump on Jan. 6, with some of the leaders moving into an Airbnb rental apartment near Chinatown.As evidence that the Proud Boys had no plan to attack the Capitol, the lawyers may tell the jurors how a musician friendly to the group — Michale Graves, the former lead singer for the punk band Misfits — was supposed to give a private concert at the rental apartment on the afternoon or evening of Jan. 6.The lawyers have also accused the government of threatening to bring charges against several other people the defense wants to call as witnesses at the trial.In court papers, the lawyers said they wanted to introduce testimony from Shannon Rusch, a former member of the Navy SEALs who marched with Mr. Biggs and Mr. Nordean toward the Capitol on Jan. 6, and Adrienna DiCioccio, a right-wing political organizer who was also at the building. 
731	But they claim the government is still investigating both Mr. Rusch’s family and Ms. DiCioccio, and has effectively scared them away from taking the stand.The lawyers have raised similar claims about a veteran Washington police officer, Lt. Shane Lamond, who could tell the jury how Mr. Tarrio was in constant contact with him before and during Jan. 6. 
732	But prosecutors have been investigating Lieutenant Lamond’s relationship with Mr. Tarrio for several months, and his lawyer has said he will most likely invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination if called as a witness.
733	Ukraine is bracing for the possibility that Russia will sharply escalate the war in a winter offensive as Moscow tries to turn the tide on the battlefield and limit political backlash at home, a senior adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sunday.Despite suffering severe setbacks over the first 10 months of war, the Russian military is now laying plans for mass infantry attacks akin to the tactics employed by the Soviet Union during World War II, the adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said in written responses to questions.Mr. 
734	Podolyak’s comments came as Ukraine’s top military and political leaders have been warning in a series of recent interviews that Russia is massing troops and armaments to launch a renewed ground offensive by spring that very likely would include a second attempt to seize Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital.Russia has already drafted and is training soldiers who might be deployed in mass infantry attacks, Mr. Podolyak said. 
735	It is one of several possible threats that Ukraine faces from Russia over the winter months, he said, as officials in Kyiv see little sign that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is seeking an end to the war.
736	“Russia’s political leadership clearly refuses to acknowledge the tactical defeats that already took place and grasps at any, even the most illusory, chances to change the situation in its favor,” Mr. Podolyak said.Ukrainian officials have said they base their assessments of Russia’s war aims on the findings of their military and foreign intelligence agencies and on consultations with allies.In his comments, Mr. Podolyak said that Ukraine was taking  the risk of a fresh Russian offensive seriously and emphasized that its allies should understand this, too. 
737	As Western governments plan for future weapons transfers to Ukraine, he suggested, the equipment should match the future threats.
738	“It is extremely important that our partners take these risks no less seriously,” he said. 
739	“Russia is not interested in ending the war until it suffers a significant military defeat and is forced to focus on its own internal political transformation.”Ukraine’s supreme military commander, Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, said in an interview with The Economist published last week that Ukraine was training and outfitting reserves to defend against a new Russian offensive that might come in January, February or March.
740	“The Russians are preparing some 200,000 fresh troops,” he said. 
741	“I have no doubt they will have another go at Kyiv.”The statements by senior Ukrainian officials appeared to be part of a coordinated campaign to guard against complacency among Ukraine’s allies as the Russian Army struggles on the battlefield. 
742	Since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February, Russia has fallen back in three major retreats — from the territory around Kyiv, in the northeastern Kharkiv region and, last month, in the southern region of Kherson.The warnings also appear to be an attempt to counter the Kremlin’s efforts to persuade Ukraine’s Western allies to pressure Kyiv into a negotiated settlement.In parallel with the fighting along the front lines, Russia has bombarded civilian infrastructure targets throughout the country, knocking out heating, water and electricity for millions of Ukrainians. 
743	In his nightly address to Ukrainians on Saturday, Mr. Zelensky said that electricity had been restored to six million people who lost power after a salvo of missile strikes on Friday. 
744	The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, said on Sunday that neighborhood heating systems damaged in the strikes had been fully restored.Military analysts say that this campaign is intended to demoralize Ukrainians and push the Ukrainian government into a cease-fire that might allow Russia time to regroup and rearm for future offensives.But analysts who rely on open-source intelligence have said it is difficult to know what is happening at Russian military training bases. 
745	The Kremlin said in September that it would mobilize 300,000 additional soldiers, and that some are already deployed in Ukraine.Mr. 
746	Podolyak said that the type of mass infantry warfare Moscow seems to be preparing for would not be effective against Ukraine’s increasingly modern arsenal of precision-guided weaponry and surveillance drones. 
747	But he said that the Russian military leadership had bent to Kremlin demands for advances on the ground for domestic political reasons.Russian commanders, he said, “diligently maintain Putin’s illusion of the possibility of ‘victory,’ in order to, firstly, maintain Putin’s personal power, and secondly, to avoid harsh punishment for admitting loss.”In their most recent setback, Russia forces retreated last month from the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson but remain within artillery range on the opposite bank of the Dnipro River. 
748	Through the day on Sunday, Russian forces fired artillery at Kherson, wounding three people, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, a deputy presidential chief of staff, said in a post on Telegram.In its morning update on the status of the battlefield on Sunday, the Ukrainian military said that it had repulsed 15 ground assaults on its positions over the past 24 hours and that multiple frontline towns and villages had been targeted by Russian artillery.Most of the attacks came in the Donbas area of eastern Ukraine, the only section of the front line where the Russian Army is regularly staging offensive attacks. 
749	Along much of the rest of the crescent-shaped front line in southeastern Ukraine, Russian forces are in a defensive crouch, building fortifications along new lines after their retreats earlier in the fall.
750	A well-known Catholic priest and incendiary leader of the anti-abortion movement was removed from the priesthood by the Vatican, according to a letter from Pope Francis’ representative to the United States that was obtained by The New York Times.Frank Pavone, who leads the advocacy organization Priests for Life, and was once a religious adviser to former President Donald J. Trump, was dismissed from the clergy on Nov. 9 with no possibility of appeal, the letter states. 
751	The letter included a statement about the removal, called laicization, that it said was approved by the Dicastery for the Clergy, a Vatican office.
752	“This action was taken after Father Pavone was found guilty in canonical proceedings of blasphemous communications on social media, and of persistent disobedience of the lawful instructions of his diocesan bishop,” it states.The letter did not specify those communications or disobedience, or name the diocesan bishop.  
753	Reached by phone on Sunday morning, Mr. Pavone said that he had not been properly notified of the decision.
754	“I’m waiting for them to point out to me what I did wrong that merits something like this,” he said. 
755	And though the Vatican has said there was no possibility of appeal, Mr. Pavone said that ultimately he and his allies “would have to appeal to the next pope” and “to the people of God.”The punishment of a high-profile Catholic anti-abortion activist comes at a precarious moment for the movement as it plans its future after losses in the midterm election and struggles to unify Republicans around the issue. 
756	Mr. Pavone’s anti-abortion activism was not cited in the letter as the reason for his dismissal.The move also comes a month after the Catholic bishops of the United States said they would redouble their efforts to end abortion and elected new leaders who are expected to continue the conservative leanings of the hierarchy.Mr. 
757	Pavone, a ubiquitous figure at anti-abortion rallies and fund-raisers, is prolific on social media. 
758	By his own account, his outspoken anti-abortion activism has won the support of some church leaders over the years but has also led to clashes with others.He is also known in the anti-abortion movement for his relationship with Norma McCorvey, the ‘Jane Roe’ of Roe v. Wade, whose lawsuit led to the U.S. Supreme Court decision nearly 50 years ago to enshrine the right to abortion in the Constitution. 
759	Ms. McCorvey later converted to Catholicism and the anti-abortion cause, at least for a time. 
760	The court rescinded the right this summer.Mr. 
761	Pavone was devoted to Mr. Trump and was among those who questioned the results of the 2020 election.His dismissal was first reported by the conservative outlet Catholic News Agency on Saturday night.On a live broadcast on social media shortly after the report, Mr. Pavone said he had received no communication from the Vatican about his removal. 
762	Wearing a leather jacket over his priest’s collar, he said he would continue his work for the anti-abortion cause.
763	“I’ve been persecuted in the church for decades, decades. This is nothing new for me,” he said. 
764	“They just don’t like the work I’m doing for these babies.”He seemed to refer to a comment on Twitter from 2020 in which he referred to “supporters of this goddamn loser Biden and his morally corrupt, America-hating, God hating Democrat party.”“I used the word G-D in a response to somebody in a tweet and for that they want to throw me out of the priesthood,” he said.The letter about his removal makes no specific reference to this incident, or to abortion beyond his affiliation.Online, Mr. Pavone seemed to compare his removal itself to abortion.
765	“In every profession, including the priesthood, if you defend the #unborn, you will be treated like them!” he wrote on Twitter on Saturday night. 
766	“The only difference is that when we are ‘aborted,’ we continue to speak, loud and clear.”Archbishop Christophe Pierre, the Pope’s representative to the United States, called the apostolic nuncio, addressed the letter dated Dec. 13 to bishops, alerting them of the decision from the Vatican. 
767	The New York Times obtained the letter from a person who had access to it but who was not authorized to share it.
768	“As you will know, Father Pavone was a very public and high profile figure associated with the Right to Life Movement in the U.S.,” Archbishop Pierre states. 
769	“His dismissal from the clerical state may, therefore, be a matter of interest among the faithful. In anticipation of that potential interest, the attached statement regarding Father Pavone is provided for your information.”The statement said that Mr. Pavone was given “ample opportunity to defend himself” as well as “multiple opportunities to submit himself to the authority of his diocesan bishop.”“It was determined that Father Pavone had no reasonable justification for his actions,” it says.The statement said the future of Mr. Pavone’s role at Priests for Life would be entirely up to the group, which it described as “not a Catholic organization.”In his broadcast, Mr. Pavone said, “You can’t cancel this message, you won’t silence this message. It’s only going to grow. We’re only going to get louder.”During the 2016 presidential election, Mr. Pavone posted a live video on Facebook in which he put an aborted fetus on what appeared to be an altar. 
770	The Diocese of Amarillo in Texas, which oversaw him at the time, announced that it opened an investigation into Mr. Pavone as a result. 
771	The diocese did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday night.Mr. 
772	Pavone clashed publicly with the bishop of the Diocese of Amarillo, Patrick Zurek, several times over the years. 
773	In the fall of 2020, the diocese issued a statement saying Catholics should disregard Mr. Pavone’s rhetoric about the election, including comments online about withholding the absolution of sin from Catholics who voted Democratic.
774	“These postings are not consistent with Catholic Church Teachings,” the diocese said in a statement at the time. 
775	“Please disregard them and pray for Father Pavone.”In the interview on Sunday, Mr. Pavone said that he believed the removal process stemmed from the Amarillo investigation. 
776	He said that he had previously told church authorities he would not participate in the process, which he saw as “tainted.” 
777	Following the report of his dismissal, Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, defended Mr. Pavone as “the one priest devoted most over the years” to taking action and building support for the anti-abortion cause, and said that she would continue to lean on him going forward.
778	“He and I see it the same way: This is the very beginning of the pro-life movement, and he has only just gotten started,” she said. 
779	Eric Scheidler, the executive director of the Pro-Life Action League, which has a long relationship with Mr. Pavone, said it was “hard to see an organization called Priests for Life headed by a man who’s not recognized as a priest by any local bishop.”Mr. 
780	Pavone’s removal could rattle his fellow activists at a sensitive time, said Mr. Scheidler, who is Catholic.
781	“It’s a time of real soul-searching and challenges for the pro-life movement as we try to rebuild after the backlash to the overturning of Roe v. Wade,” he said.
782	By Eric Lipton, Michael Crowley and John IsmayWASHINGTON — The prospect of growing military threats from both China and Russia is driving bipartisan support for a surge in Pentagon spending, setting up another potential boom for weapons makers that is likely to extend beyond the war in Ukraine.Congress is on track in the coming week to give final approval to a national military budget for the current fiscal year that is expected to reach approximately $858 billion — or $45 billion above what President Biden had requested.If approved at this level, the Pentagon budget will have grown at 4.3 percent per year over the last two years — even after inflation — compared with an average of less than 1 percent a year in real dollars between 2015 and 2021, according to an analysis by Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments for The New York Times.Spending on procurement would rise sharply next year, including a 55 percent jump in Army funding to buy new missiles and a 47 percent jump for the Navy’s weapons purchases.On Friday, Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden’s national security adviser, put the buildup in strategic terms, saying the war in Ukraine had exposed shortfalls in the nation’s military industrial base that needed to be addressed to ensure the United States is “able to support Ukraine and to be able to deal with contingencies elsewhere in the world.”Lockheed Martin, the nation’s largest military contractor, had booked more than $950 million worth of its own missile military orders from the Pentagon in part to refill stockpiles being used in Ukraine. 
783	The Army has awarded Raytheon Technologies more than $2 billion in contracts to deliver missile systems to expand or replenish weapons used to help Ukraine.
784	“We went through six years of Stingers in 10 months,” Gregory J. Hayes, Raytheon’s chief executive, said in an interview earlier this month, referring to 1,600 of the company’s shoulder-fired antiaircraft missiles sent by the U.S. government to Ukraine. 
785	“So it will take us multiple years to restock and replenish.”But those contracts are just the leading edge of what is shaping up to be a big new defense buildup. 
786	Military spending next year is on track to reach its highest level in inflation-adjusted terms since the peaks in the costs of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars between 2008 and 2011, and the second highest in inflation-adjusted terms since World War II — a level that is more than the budgets for the next 10 largest cabinet agencies combined.Even more orders are coming in to military contractors from U.S. allies in Europe and Asia, as they too have concluded they must do more to arm themselves against rising global threats. 
787	Japan moved this month to double its spending on defense over the next five years, putting aside a pacifist stand it has largely maintained since 1945.And none of this counts an estimated $18 billion of planned but now delayed weapons deliveries by the United States to arm Taiwan against a possible future attack by China.The combination of the Ukraine war and the growing consensus about the emergence of a new era of superpower confrontation is prompting efforts to ensure the military industrial base can respond to surges in demand. 
788	The issue has become urgent in some cases as the U.S. and its NATO allies seek to keep weapons flowing to Ukraine without diminishing their own stocks to worrisome levels.The Ukrainian military has run through years’ worth of the missile production capacity of Western suppliers in a matter of months. 
789	At the same time, contractors remain concerned about investing to meet growing demand for weapons that could dry up again when the war ends or politics shifts course.
790	“The difficulty of starting a production line back up, that doesn’t come for free,” Tom Arseneault, president of BAE Systems, which is now considering restarting its M777 howitzer manufacturing line, which the company had been in the process of shutting down. 
791	The M777 is a highly accurate, towed gun that fires 155-millimeter artillery shells, which are also in diminishing supply.The annual military authorization bill that passed the Senate on Thursday prevents the Air Force and Navy from retiring aging weapons systems that the military would like to take out of service, including certain C-130 transport planes or F-22 fighter jets. 
792	At the same time, it includes billions of dollars in extra money to build even more new ships and planes than the Pentagon itself asked for, including $2.2 billion alone for an extra Navy-guided missile destroyer, according to the Senate Armed Services Committee.And there is $678 million to expand ammunition plants in spots such as Scranton, Pa.
793	; Middletown, Iowa; and Kingsport, Tenn., where contractors work with the Army to manufacture the ammunition that Ukrainian artillery crews have burned through at an alarming rate. 
794	(The money for these programs is expected to be included in a huge appropriations bill that appears to be on track to pass Congress and signed into law by Mr. Biden by the end of the week.)Spending could be even higher, as Congress is also considering a request for an extra $21.7 billion for the Pentagon, above the already expanded 2023 annual budget, to allocate more money to resupply materials used in Ukraine.In an indication of how government policy is shifting to rebuild industrial capacity for the military, Congress this year has moved to allow the Defense Department to more broadly make multiyear spending commitments for certain weapons systems and shipbuilding operations. 
795	That is a provision that industry lobbyists have long pushed for, arguing it gives companies certainty that investments they make to start production will see continued returns in future years.
796	“We have to make a commitment with the industry,” said Senator Deb Fischer, Republican of Nebraska and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who supported the change. 
797	“Then the industry will step forward to restart or grow their production lines.”That move alone suggests $73 billion in additional munitions orders could be on the way in the next three years, contracts that will largely benefit the big players like Lockheed and Raytheon, according to an analysis by Myles Walton, a military industry analyst at Wolfe Research, a Wall Street research firm.These trends help explain stock market performance of the major military contractors — a small group of which control the bulk of sales to the Pentagon. 
798	Lockheed and Northrop Grumman both have seen their stock prices jump more than 35 percent so far this year in a market whose main indexes are down overall for the year.Opponents of higher military budgets say they are frustrated.Military contractors are “riding high again, and Ukraine just gives them another argument as to why things need to continue onward and upward,” said William D. Hartung, a fellow at the non-interventionist Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft.
799	“The trillion-dollar defense budget — that is where we are headed,” said Lawrence J. Korb, who served as an assistant defense secretary during the Reagan administration and was once a vice president at Raytheon. 
800	“Nobody seems to want to make the tough choices. Even the Democrats now seem to be afraid to be seen as being soft on defense.”The biggest barrier for growth for major military contractors — the list includes Lockheed, Raytheon, Boeing, General Dynamics, BAE, Northrop Grumman and Huntington Ingalls Industries — is finding sufficient supplies of key components, such as microelectronics and missile warheads, as well as a steady supply of new employees to assemble all these items.
801	“You cannot throw much more money at the seven shipbuilders that build U.S. warships in the United States of America right now,” Adm. Michael M. Gilday, the chief of naval operations, said this month during the Reagan National Defense Forum in California, referring to a $32.6 billion shipbuilding budget in the military authorization bill that is $4.7 billion more than the Pentagon requested. 
802	“Their capacity is about at max. And Congress is helping us max them out.”Raytheon, which has 180,000 workers, has hired 27,000 new employees so far this year, its chief executive said in October. 
803	But even with that, it is still running into bottlenecks in terms of available parts and labor shortages that are slowing sales, its executives said.The sheer scale of the munitions and missiles sent to Ukraine illustrates just how much matériel a war can consume.That includes more than 104 million rounds of small-arms ammunition, at least one million rounds of 155-millimeter artillery shells, 46,000 anti-tank weapons, more than 1,600 Stinger antiaircraft missiles and 8,500 Javelin anti-armor missiles, according to a Pentagon tally.The resupply challenge is not just a matter of money. 
804	Military contractors have nearly stopped manufacturing Stingers — Raytheon’s last contract from the U.S. government was in 2002, Mr. Haynes said. 
805	And while Javelins are still being made jointly by Raytheon and Lockheed — in September they were awarded a $311 million contract to deliver more of them — historically they have been able to make only about 2,100 a year, or about a quarter of what Ukraine has burned through since the outbreak of the war in February.In total, the Pentagon as of early December had awarded at least $6 billion to military contractors to resupply these and other items sent to Ukraine.
806	“We’re going to ramp up,” Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said this month. 
807	“We’ve really been working closely with industry to both increase their capacity and also the speed at which they’re able to produce.”The overall spending on national defense still remains relatively low as a percentage of the nation’s economy: about 3.2 percent of the gross domestic product this year, compared to 37 percent during World War II and 13 percent during the Korean War, according to Pentagon records.Still, companies are scrambling to avoid or resolve bottlenecks caused by the increase in demand.Lockheed, for example, spent more than $60 million of its own money in advance of getting Pentagon contract commitment to build more of its High Mobility Artillery Rocket System vehicles, or HIMARS, which fire guided rockets carrying 200 pounds of explosives that can hit targets nearly 50 miles away. 
808	The vehicles have been much sought after by Ukraine, which has used them to devastating effect against the Russians.Traditionally, Lockheed has been able to build 60 of these trucks per year, but it is now shifting production to 24 hours a day and seven days a week in an effort to bring that annual total to 96 units. 
809	It also now has a new $430 million contract to deliver more HIMARS, along with a new $521 million contract to build more of the rockets, called GMLRS, that these vehicles can fire.These resupply orders, while large in terms of many other contracts the federal government issues, are still relatively small for the biggest contractors. 
810	At Lockheed, for example, about 70 percent of sales come from the U.S. government, and most of the rest from other governments worldwide. 
811	Supply chain and labor shortage problems are cutting into sales and profits, including at Lockheed, which expects to see annual sales decline this year to $62.3 billion from $67 billion.
812	“The clutch is engaging but into some lower gears initially,” James Taiclet, Lockheed’s chief executive, said in October, adding that higher sales might not show up for another year.But there are more of the big-ticket orders coming. 
813	In the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Switzerland and Germany have both moved in recent months to finalize orders for the F-35 fighter jets, collectively worth $16 billion. 
814	Overall foreign military sales notifications to Congress so far in 2022 have totaled $81 billion, the third highest figure in the last 25 years, with an increasing share of these sales going to European and Asian nations.Next year’s military budget also includes major investments in new hypersonic weapons that are also being aggressively pursued by China. 
815	Raytheon and Northrop Grumman in September won a $1 billion contract just to build prototypes for the Air Force.Other companies want to replace older equipment sent to Ukraine with newer models. 
816	BAE, for example, intends to sell the Army more armored vehicles called AMPVs, in place of the more than 200 of BAE’s Vietnam-era M113 armored personnel carriers sent to Ukraine, which it no longer makes.
817	“Nothing’s cheap, right?” said Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro  this month at the conference in California, as he ran through many new investments the Navy is making. 
818	“Nothing’s free.”Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.
819	When Chris Licht told his boss, Stephen Colbert, the host of the CBS program “Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” in February that he had been offered the chief executive job at CNN, Mr. Colbert was blunt: “Definitely don’t go do that.”But for Mr. Licht, nothing less than democracy itself was at stake. 
820	He argued he could make CNN a news channel that people trusted, as opposed to one that monetized partisan combat.
821	“Oh, man, you used to be in news, remember?” 
822	Mr. Colbert recalled telling him. 
823	“You said this was so much nicer — 12 weeks off, good pay, laugh for an hour every night. Everyone is really nice; you can say anything you want, and nobody leaks it. It’s great.”“CNN would be lucky to get you,” Mr. Colbert continued. 
824	“But you’re my friend, and I’m telling you not to go.”“This is a calling,” Mr. Licht countered.At which point Mr. Colbert stopped trying to dissuade him: “I can’t negotiate with a calling.”On Feb. 28, Mr. Licht was named CNN’s new chief executive. 
825	Since then, he and Mr. Colbert have spoken nearly every Friday. 
826	Each time, Mr. Colbert begins with the same four words:“I told you so.”By almost any measure, Mr. Licht, 51, has had a rough start. 
827	His first major act was to kill the network’s fledgling streaming service, CNN+, and fire 400 or so people working on it. 
828	CNN’s revenue and profits have plunged to a projected $750 million this year, down from $1.25 billion last year, partly from the costs associated with CNN+, the network acknowledged. 
829	CNN’s ratings declined, on average, this year compared with 2021, according to Nielsen, with CNN falling behind MSNBC for the first time in prime time on election night among total viewers. 
830	(CNN prevailed in the coveted 25-to-54 age group.)At the end of November, Mr. Licht levied another round of job cuts — this time just under 10 percent of CNN’s work force of about 4,000, which plunged morale further. 
831	Among the casualties were familiar commentators like Chris Cillizza, key behind-the-scenes producers with decades of experience, and the entirety of HLN, CNN’s sister network, and its popular morning host, Robin Meade.A chorus of media pundits has pounced on every tidbit of bad news. 
832	Mr. Licht’s early programming efforts aimed at repositioning the network as broader and less partisan have prompted howls of criticism, with former MSNBC host and former colleague Keith Olbermann publicly calling Mr. Licht a “TV Fascist” after he moved Don Lemon, a liberal host, from a prime-time slot to a revamped morning show.
833	“The uninformed vitriol, especially from the left, has been stunning,” Mr. Licht said in one of several interviews with The New York Times spanning his nearly eight-month tenure. 
834	“Which proves my point: so much of what passes for news is name-calling, half-truths and desperation.”Mr. 
835	Licht said he was under no illusion that stepping into the chief executive job would be easy or make him popular. 
836	The network’s previous parent, the telecommunications giant AT&T, had just spun off its Warner Media subsidiary, which included CNN, into a new company run by Discovery’s chief executive, David Zaslav.Just two months before the companies merged and only weeks before CNN+ was introduced to the world, the network’s popular and longtime chief executive, Jeff Zucker, was forced to resign after failing to disclose a romantic relationship with his top lieutenant, Allison Gollust. 
837	Some at CNN felt Mr. Zucker had been unfairly sacrificed and remained staunchly loyal to their former boss.CNN had also become the poster child for the poisoned relationship between former President Donald J. Trump and mainstream media organizations. 
838	Mr. Trump repeatedly branded CNN as “fake news,” and his administration engaged in open warfare with CNN correspondents like Jim Acosta, whom Mr. Trump once called “a rude, terrible person” during a news conference. 
839	In 2018, CNN’s New York headquarters had to be evacuated after a bomb threat.CNN remained enviably profitable, earning over $1 billion a year for the past five years. 
840	But cable news, along with all cable channels, has been in secular decline, troubled by shifting viewer habits in an era of cord cutting and an exodus to streaming services and online news sites.It’s not clear anyone could surmount those challenges, let alone someone who’d just spent nearly six years at a late-night entertainment show and had never managed a complex, globe-spanning organization with thousands of employees.So why even take the job?
841	Mr. 
842	Licht seemed to have TV news in his DNA. 
843	As a child, he’d created a fictional TV news network, WBC, and produced his own newscast using a VCR camera in his basement in Newtown, Conn. 
844	At about the age of 9, he met the NBC legal correspondent Carl Stern on a family vacation and, in Mr. Licht’s telling, “stuck to him like glue.” 
845	Mr. Licht pried the newsman’s phone number from him and used it regularly. 
846	“I was obsessed,” Mr. Licht said. 
847	After college at Syracuse University, Mr. Licht landed jobs at NBC affiliates in Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
848	As a reporter and producer, he covered a mass shooting in San Bernardino, the plane crash that killed John F. Kennedy Jr., two presidential campaigns and three Olympics.In 2005, he moved to NBC’s sibling network, MSNBC, soon becoming an executive producer for “Morning Joe,” which he helped develop into an improbable success in its hotly competitive morning time slot. 
849	Notably, the two hosts, the former Republican politician Joe Scarborough and the more liberal former CBS correspondent Mika Brzezinski, straddled the political divide. 
850	The tension between them seemed to enhance their audience appeal. 
851	Mr. Licht encouraged them to be themselves and embrace the unexpected. 
852	(They later married.)Mr. 
853	Licht moved to CBS in 2010, where he’d scored another early morning success. 
854	He lifted ratings at the perennial also-ran “CBS This Morning” on the strength of the program’s three hosts, Charlie Rose, Gayle King and Norah O’Donnell, and an emphasis on news and in-depth interviews, rather than the lighter fare format of its competitors “Today” and “Good Morning America.”After having a brain aneurysm in 2010 when he was still under 40, Mr. Licht wrote a book about what he learned from the experience, while still describing himself as a “killer TV producer” with “no urge to surrender my spot in the fast lane,” even after the near-fatal incident.Restless after six years at “This Morning,” in 2016 he joined the then-faltering CBS program “Late Show With Stephen Colbert.” 
855	Within a year, Mr. Colbert had seized the late-night ratings crown from Jimmy Fallon of NBC’s “Tonight Show.”Soon after the Warner-Discovery deal was announced, Mr. Zaslav summoned Mr. Licht to Discovery’s headquarters in Manhattan on 19th Street and asked what he thought of CNN.Mr. 
856	Licht told him he had no interest in running it. 
857	“I got out of news, and I’m not going back,” Mr. Licht had insisted.Mr. 
858	Zaslav ignored the demurral. 
859	Over the next several weeks, he kept making the case to Mr. Licht. 
860	In fact, Mr. Zaslav said in an interview that he never considered anyone else for the job.The two men have known each other for 15 years, since both were working at NBC, where Mr. Zaslav helped start MSNBC. 
861	In the years since, they have had breakfast once a quarter. 
862	Mr. Licht has looked to Mr. Zaslav as a mentor, and Mr. Zaslav has admired Mr. Licht’s work ethic and drive.
863	“He’s a fighter, and he likes to win,” Mr. Zaslav said.At their first meeting, Mr. Zaslav argued that running CNN would be “a great opportunity to build the No. 1 news brand in the world,” and “the most trusted brand in news where people go every day and in a crisis for the best version of the truth.”And more than that: “This is important for America. It’s important for a functioning society.”Mr. 
864	Licht and Mr. Zaslav — not to mention Warner’s largest shareholder, the media mogul John Malone — were philosophically aligned. 
865	Fox and MSNBC were “advocacy” networks, as Mr. Zaslav put it, a proven business model appealing to like-minded viewers but of scant, if any, value as a public service. 
866	Whether by design or happenstance, he believed CNN had tacked left, a pale version of MSNBC that nonetheless alienated wide parts of the American electorate with a focus on politics and the president at the time, Mr. Trump.Ted Turner’s mantra had always been “the news is the star.” 
867	Mr. Trump “is not the star,” Mr. Zaslav said.Yet Mr. Licht was noncommittal. 
868	On a subsequent phone call, Mr. Zaslav urged Mr. Licht to think about CNN and whether he’d be interested in the top job. 
869	After Mr. Licht hung up, his wife, Jennifer Blanco Licht, a former TV executive herself, asked: “Is this crazy? I think you should do it.”The two men continued the conversation on a long walk in Central Park. 
870	(They both live near the park.) 
871	During that conversation, Mr. Zaslav warned Mr. Licht that he’d be closely scrutinized and judged harshly. 
872	Is your family ready for this? 
873	Are you ready for this? 
874	Because “it will be brutal,” Mr. Zaslav said.Mr. 
875	Licht said he doesn’t recall Mr. Zaslav ever offering him the job, or his accepting it. 
876	At one point, Mr. Zaslav simply asked, “Who’s your lawyer?” and started acting like Mr. Licht was CNN’s future chief executive. 
877	A contract ensued.On their first lunch afterward, at Mr. Zaslav’s usual corner table at Gramercy Tavern, Mr. Zaslav indicated their yearslong relationship had fundamentally changed. 
878	“We’ve been friends for 15 years,” Mr. Zaslav said. 
879	“We’re not friends any more. You work for me.”Almost immediately, their shared vision of saving democracy ran into the harsh reality of cable news economics.With Fox News and MSNBC having already staked out the right and left ends of the political spectrum, attracting the middle (what Mr. Licht referred to as “normal” people) has proved elusive. 
880	Mr. Zaslav had stressed that he didn’t care — at least not much — about CNN’s current ratings, revenue or profitability. 
881	He recognized that it would take years to reposition and rebuild the network. 
882	But even he had his limits.AT&T’s board had approved an ambitious budget of $350 million for CNN+, much of it already spent by the time Mr. Licht arrived. 
883	Many more millions would be needed. 
884	With Warner facing pressure from Wall Street to find $3 billion in savings, on April 21, Mr. Licht killed the streaming service after less than a month on air.In an effort to restore morale and calm anxiety, Mr. Licht assured CNN employees at a network-wide town hall meeting on May 5 that Warner Bros. 
885	Discovery didn’t anticipate further job cuts at CNN because there was no overlap between the news network and Discovery’s cable channels, and thus there wasn’t anyone else doing the same jobs that would need to be cut. 
886	In a series of additional town hall meetings, most of them leaked almost immediately to The New York Times and other news outlets, Mr. Licht also laid the groundwork for the network’s shift to broader, less political and less partisan coverage. 
887	This was not, he stressed repeatedly, a move to the “center,” a boring, political neutral zone that Mr. Licht wasn’t even sure existed. 
888	Rather, it was an attempt to explore controversial issues from varied perspectives — not to tell people “what to think,” as he put it, but “how to think,” or what he called a “blueprint for how to make decisions.”In July, Mr. Licht made a highly symbolic pilgrimage to Capitol Hill noteworthy for its inclusion of Republicans like the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, and Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas. 
889	Although he spent equal time with Democratic leaders like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Mr. Licht was irritated that his visit was billed as an “apology tour” and effort to coax Republicans back onto the network — part of CNN’s perceived move to the right.After long absences, several Republicans have since appeared on CNN, including Mr. McCarthy and Senator Rick Scott of Florida.Featuring hosts and guests with opposing points of view and playing up controversy has paid ratings dividends on cable in the past, notably on CNN’s own “Crossfire,” which came under criticism for evolving into to a verbal food fight criticized by the comedian Jon Stewart as “hurting America.”But Mr. Licht said he wasn’t interested in controversy for its own sake, but to offer a “rational conversation about polarizing issues.” 
890	After watching CNN, he hopes people will “take what they’ve heard to the dinner table and have a discussion,” he said. 
891	“That’s a dream of mine.”Two examples have been coverage of the abortion debate in the wake of the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade, and the debate over gun rights. 
892	To vocal criticism from the left, he hired Stephen Gutowski, founder and editor of The Reload, a firearms website. 
893	No one wants a school shooting, said Mr. Licht, whose hometown, Newtown, was the site of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre. 
894	“But we have to understand the culture of people who like guns,” he said.
895	“This is not vanilla, centrist or boring,” he added.Mr. 
896	Licht has barely begun to put his stamp on the network’s programming, but it’s already evident in the new morning show, “CNN This Morning.” 
897	Mr. Licht picked the hosts, persuading the left-leaning Don Lemon to trade his prime-time slot for early morning, and pairing him with the former Daily Caller reporter and CNN White House correspondent Kaitlan Collins and Poppy Harlow, a former host of “CNN Newsroom.” 
898	The show takes a somewhat similar approach to the one he used at “CBS This Morning” (which also shares a near-identical name).
899	In a series of interviews with The Times, Mr. Licht visibly came to life talking about “This Morning” and its co-hosts. 
900	“They obviously like each other,” he said. 
901	“The chemistry is great. I love the collaboration. Every day, it evolves. It’s not like me giving orders. It’s so much fun.”“This Morning” debuted on Nov. 1. 
902	The New York Post (which shares ownership with CNN’s rival, Fox News) reported the next day that “‘CNN This Morning’ bombs in debut,” drawing just 387,000 viewers, far behind rival morning shows and trailing its predecessor on CNN, “New Day.” 
903	CNN called the instant critique “absurd and cheap” after just one day’s data. 
904	(Since then, the show has gained slightly among total viewers.) 
905	More significantly, Mr. Licht noted, “This Morning” has broken news, including the chief Washington correspondent Jake Tapper’s scoop that Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona was leaving the Democratic Party to become an Independent.Prime time looms as an even greater challenge. 
906	In August, Mr. Licht moved Mr. Tapper from his 4 p.m. anchor position to the coveted 9 p.m. slot that had been vacated by Chris Cuomo after CNN fired him for what it deemed inappropriate efforts to help his brother, New York’s former governor, Andrew Cuomo, fend off the sexual harassment allegations that led to his resignation from office. 
907	The experiment with Mr. Tapper fared poorly in the ratings and lasted just one month.Mr. 
908	Licht acknowledged that prime time remains an “open canvas.” 
909	He said he and his colleagues were meeting and “throwing things against the wall, looking at off-the-beaten path opportunities.” 
910	Among the names tossed out have been entertainment, comedy and sports figures. 
911	He declined to be more specific but promised surprises.Miklos Sarvary, a professor and director of the media and technology program at Columbia Business School, said that entertainment was potentially more profitable than low-margin news. 
912	“But what does that do to the brand if you want to be the most trusted name in news?” he said. 
913	“News is supposed to be serious. I’m not sure that putting on a comedian is a great move for credibility.”Mr. 
914	Licht said he understood Mr. Sarvary’s point, but said prime time offered “some leeway for being a little different.”“It has to be compelling and entertaining without hurting the news brand,” he said, citing his former boss Mr. Colbert, and Mr. Stewart as “the kind of people who’d work,” while acknowledging that Mr. Stewart is already locked into a lucrative contract at Apple TV.Every Saturday, Mr. Licht sends Mr. Zaslav a memo with highlights of the week and programming and financial updates. 
915	Mr. Licht’s growth strategy is focused on CNN.com, which attracts more than 200 million unique visitors each month, according to CNN. 
916	But at its peak, CNN digital generated only about 10 percent of the network’s profits, Mr. Licht confirmed.On Oct. 13, Mr. Licht made his debut in front of Warner Brother Discovery’s board at a hotel in Los Angeles, where he outlined both his growth and content strategy. 
917	Asked about his efforts to make CNN less partisan, Mr. Licht gave this analogy: Suppose it’s raining outside. 
918	CNN plans to have people on who love the rain, and it will have people on who say they don’t like the rain. 
919	But it won’t have anyone on who says it’s sunny out.Mr. 
920	Licht said he used the analogy to make clear that a less-partisan CNN did not mean it was any less committed to truth. 
921	“This wasn’t to plot a new course but to assure people we would not let up one inch in being truth tellers,” he said. 
922	“The change is we will not do Trump 24/7 or let him dictate our agenda.”By all accounts, Mr. Licht’s presentation was warmly received by directors, including Mr. Malone.Mr. 
923	Licht’s vision is contending with industrywide pressures to cut costs. 
924	(He said he appreciates but doesn’t really believe Mr. Zaslav’s professed indifference to financial results.) 
925	By announcing the need for more layoffs on Oct. 26, he said he hoped to engage in a “transparent” process that would leave everyone feeling they’d been heard. 
926	But, he said, “it would be irresponsible not to do the tough work now.” 
927	He added, “I promise you CNN will be more profitable next year.”However transparent, many in CNN’s rank and file felt blindsided by the cuts, especially after what they perceived as his earlier reassurances that no further layoffs would be needed. 
928	In a all-staff meeting in November, Mr. Licht said he stood by his earlier remark that there would be no merger-related layoffs, and “I absolutely would not have said something that I did not believe to be true.” 
929	But he said he understood how his remarks had hurt his credibility. 
930	“I have to win that credibility back,” he acknowledged.Mr. 
931	Licht said the firings were the “low point” of his tenure so far.At another all-staff meeting this month, aimed at restoring morale, Mr. Licht took questions and then ended with a passage he wrote himself:In terms of morale, let me just say, you work at a world-renowned news organization alongside the best journalists on the globe. 
932	Your jobs have meaning. 
933	Your jobs have an impact. 
934	You are part of something bigger, of something with tremendous meaning. 
935	And nothing about that has changed. 
936	And you have in me as a leader, who has done a lot of your jobs, someone who has your back every step of the way. 
937	My loyalty is first and foremost to this organization and to journalism without fear or favor to anyone else, including our parent company.That’s why I’m here. 
938	That’s why I took this job.
939	“I want CNN to be essential to society,” Mr. Licht said in one of our interviews. 
940	“If you’re essential then the revenue will follow.”And if it doesn’t?
941	“Maybe it won’t work,” Mr. Licht conceded. 
942	“But I’d rather try to win this way.”Benjamin Mullin and Michael M. Grynbaum contributed reporting.
943	A well-known Catholic priest and incendiary leader of the anti-abortion movement was removed from the priesthood by the Vatican, according to a letter from Pope Francis’ representative to the United States that was obtained by The New York Times.Frank Pavone, who leads the advocacy organization Priests for Life, and was once a religious adviser to former President Donald J. Trump, was dismissed from the clergy on Nov. 9 with no possibility of appeal, the letter states. 
944	The letter included a statement about the removal, called laicization, that it said was approved by the Dicastery for the Clergy, a Vatican office.
945	“This action was taken after Father Pavone was found guilty in canonical proceedings of blasphemous communications on social media, and of persistent disobedience of the lawful instructions of his diocesan bishop,” it states.The letter did not specify those communications or disobedience, or name the diocesan bishop.  
946	Reached by phone on Sunday morning, Mr. Pavone said that he had not been properly notified of the decision.
947	“I’m waiting for them to point out to me what I did wrong that merits something like this,” he said. 
948	And though the Vatican has said there was no possibility of appeal, Mr. Pavone said that ultimately he and his allies “would have to appeal to the next pope” and “to the people of God.”The punishment of a high-profile Catholic anti-abortion activist comes at a precarious moment for the movement as it plans its future after losses in the midterm election and struggles to unify Republicans around the issue. 
949	Mr. Pavone’s anti-abortion activism was not cited in the letter as the reason for his dismissal.The move also comes a month after the Catholic bishops of the United States said they would redouble their efforts to end abortion and elected new leaders who are expected to continue the conservative leanings of the hierarchy.Mr. 
950	Pavone, a ubiquitous figure at anti-abortion rallies and fund-raisers, is prolific on social media. 
951	By his own account, his outspoken anti-abortion activism has won the support of some church leaders over the years but has also led to clashes with others.He is also known in the anti-abortion movement for his relationship with Norma McCorvey, the ‘Jane Roe’ of Roe v. Wade, whose lawsuit led to the U.S. Supreme Court decision nearly 50 years ago to enshrine the right to abortion in the Constitution. 
952	Ms. McCorvey later converted to Catholicism and the anti-abortion cause, at least for a time. 
953	The court rescinded the right this summer.Mr. 
954	Pavone was devoted to Mr. Trump and was among those who questioned the results of the 2020 election.His dismissal was first reported by the conservative outlet Catholic News Agency on Saturday night.On a live broadcast on social media shortly after the report, Mr. Pavone said he had received no communication from the Vatican about his removal. 
955	Wearing a leather jacket over his priest’s collar, he said he would continue his work for the anti-abortion cause.
956	“I’ve been persecuted in the church for decades, decades. This is nothing new for me,” he said. 
957	“They just don’t like the work I’m doing for these babies.”He seemed to refer to a comment on Twitter from 2020 in which he referred to “supporters of this goddamn loser Biden and his morally corrupt, America-hating, God hating Democrat party.”“I used the word G-D in a response to somebody in a tweet and for that they want to throw me out of the priesthood,” he said.The letter about his removal makes no specific reference to this incident, or to abortion beyond his affiliation.Online, Mr. Pavone seemed to compare his removal itself to abortion.
958	“In every profession, including the priesthood, if you defend the #unborn, you will be treated like them!” he wrote on Twitter on Saturday night. 
959	“The only difference is that when we are ‘aborted,’ we continue to speak, loud and clear.”Archbishop Christophe Pierre, the Pope’s representative to the United States, called the apostolic nuncio, addressed the letter dated Dec. 13 to bishops, alerting them of the decision from the Vatican. 
960	The New York Times obtained the letter from a person who had access to it but who was not authorized to share it.
961	“As you will know, Father Pavone was a very public and high profile figure associated with the Right to Life Movement in the U.S.,” Archbishop Pierre states. 
962	“His dismissal from the clerical state may, therefore, be a matter of interest among the faithful. In anticipation of that potential interest, the attached statement regarding Father Pavone is provided for your information.”The statement said that Mr. Pavone was given “ample opportunity to defend himself” as well as “multiple opportunities to submit himself to the authority of his diocesan bishop.”“It was determined that Father Pavone had no reasonable justification for his actions,” it says.The statement said the future of Mr. Pavone’s role at Priests for Life would be entirely up to the group, which it described as “not a Catholic organization.”In his broadcast, Mr. Pavone said, “You can’t cancel this message, you won’t silence this message. It’s only going to grow. We’re only going to get louder.”During the 2016 presidential election, Mr. Pavone posted a live video on Facebook in which he put an aborted fetus on what appeared to be an altar. 
963	The Diocese of Amarillo in Texas, which oversaw him at the time, announced that it opened an investigation into Mr. Pavone as a result. 
964	The diocese did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday night.Mr. 
965	Pavone clashed publicly with the bishop of the Diocese of Amarillo, Patrick Zurek, several times over the years. 
966	In the fall of 2020, the diocese issued a statement saying Catholics should disregard Mr. Pavone’s rhetoric about the election, including comments online about withholding the absolution of sin from Catholics who voted Democratic.
967	“These postings are not consistent with Catholic Church Teachings,” the diocese said in a statement at the time. 
968	“Please disregard them and pray for Father Pavone.”In the interview on Sunday, Mr. Pavone said that he believed the removal process stemmed from the Amarillo investigation. 
969	He said that he had previously told church authorities he would not participate in the process, which he saw as “tainted.” 
970	Following the report of his dismissal, Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, defended Mr. Pavone as “the one priest devoted most over the years” to taking action and building support for the anti-abortion cause, and said that she would continue to lean on him going forward.
971	“He and I see it the same way: This is the very beginning of the pro-life movement, and he has only just gotten started,” she said. 
972	Eric Scheidler, the executive director of the Pro-Life Action League, which has a long relationship with Mr. Pavone, said it was “hard to see an organization called Priests for Life headed by a man who’s not recognized as a priest by any local bishop.”Mr. 
973	Pavone’s removal could rattle his fellow activists at a sensitive time, said Mr. Scheidler, who is Catholic.
974	“It’s a time of real soul-searching and challenges for the pro-life movement as we try to rebuild after the backlash to the overturning of Roe v. Wade,” he said.
975	Milton Viorst, who melded journalism and history to presage the chaotic consequences of an American invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the improbability of peace in the Middle East unless Israel agreed to a separate Palestinian state, died on Dec. 9 in Washington. 
976	He was 92.His wife, the author Judith Viorst, said the cause of his death, in a hospital, was complications of Covid-19.An American Jew and a self-described liberal Democrat, Mr. Viorst (pronounced VEE-orst) warned that the American invasion of Iraq and the toppling of Saddam Hussein would empower Iranian militants in the region. 
977	He also argued that by granting almost every request for advanced weaponry, America was killing Israel with kindness by subverting its original Zionist goals and transforming it into a regional superpower.Over seven decades, in 10 books, regular columns for The New Yorker and many essays, book reviews and other articles for The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, Harper’s Magazine and Foreign Affairs, he synthesized shoe-leather reporting with scholarly insights into the roots of Arab nationalism and Middle East conflicts dating from the seventh century.
978	“Whatever the military mismatch, the West has not had an easy time subduing the Arabs,” Mr. Viorst wrote in “Storm From the East: The Struggle Between the Arab World and the Christian West” (2006).
979	“America’s war in Iraq, igniting an explosion of Arab nationalism, is the latest round in this long contest,” he concluded. 
980	“To see it otherwise is to deny the evidence of history.”He once described his book “Sands of Sorrow: Israel’s Journey From Independence” (1987) as “part journalism, part historical and political commentary, part personal odyssey” from the perspective of a Jewish American.Forging a colloidal analysis from facts and opinion in the minefield of Middle Eastern diplomacy was a contentious enough undertaking on its own. 
981	His conclusions compounded the criticism he received.He was a supporter of Israel’s existence, as evidenced by a review he wrote in The New York Times in 1984 of “Warriors for Jerusalem,” a book about the 1967 war by Donald Neff that described the conflict as “the worst tragedy in the modern history of the Middle East.”“But if one accepts as an axiom Israel’s existence — as I do and as, I believe, Mr. Neff does, too — then the Six-Day War settled a great deal,” Mr. Viorst wrote. 
982	“It persuaded all the parties that Israel would not be destroyed by arms. De facto, it legitimized Israel. Thereafter, political legitimation inexorably has to follow.”The war, Mr. Viorst added, “was a necessary prelude to the peace that now exists between Israel and Egypt.”He advocated a separate Palestinian state on the West Bank as the only route to peace, and he insisted that the robust flow of sophisticated weapons from the United States to Israel, demanded by an “Israel lobby” of conservative American Jews, had transformed Israel from its original ideals. 
983	He also argued that Israel should accept the Palestine Liberation Organization as a negotiating partner.Reviewing “Sands of Sorrow” in Foreign Affairs, John C. Campbell called it “remarkably perceptive, honest, well written and understanding of the views and motives of all parties concerned” in its exploration of how “Israel has become an aggressive regional superpower.”Mr. 
984	Viorst also received criticism from scholars like Edward Said, the Columbia University professor who was a leading champion of the Palestinian cause.In a debate in The Nation magazine in 1999, Professor Said accused Mr. Viorst of “Orientalist ignorance” and “racist highhandedness” for praising the legacy of King Hussein of Jordan.Mr. 
985	Viorst also incurred the wrath of President Richard M. Nixon. 
986	He was among the 220 individuals and organizations on an expanded version of Nixon’s so-called enemies list after he joined other writers and editors in 1968 in pledging not to pay taxes as a protest against the Vietnam War.His opposition to the war, he said, was apparently enough to qualify him for the list. 
987	In his book “Fire in the Streets: America in the 1960s” (1980), he wrote about the political system’s inability to accommodate the “dynamism” that the war and other issues had unleashed.Among his other books were “Hostile Allies: FDR and Charles de Gaulle” (1965), “Sandcastles: The Arabs in Search of the Modern World” (1994), “In the Shadow of the Prophet: The Struggle for the Soul of Islam” (1998) and “Storm From the East: The Struggle between the Arab World and the Christian West” (2006).
988	Milton Viorst was born on Feb. 18, 1930, in Paterson, N.J. His father, Louis, sold shoes. 
989	His mother, Betty (LeVine) Viorst, was a sales clerk and a homemaker.After graduating from Eastside High School in Paterson, he earned a bachelor’s degree in history from Rutgers University in 1951. 
990	He then studied at the University of Lyon in France as a Fulbright scholar and served two years as an Air Force intelligence officer. 
991	He earned master’s degrees in history from Harvard University in 1955 and in journalism from Columbia University in 1956.He worked first for The Bergen Record in New Jersey and then, from 1957 to 1961, at The Washington Post. 
992	He later wrote for The New York Post from Washington and was a political columnist for The Washington Star.In addition to his wife, the writer of popular children’s books including “Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day” (1972), he is survived by three sons, Anthony, Nicholas and Alexander; and seven grandchildren.For all his apparent prescience about the Iraq war and his warnings that any permanent Middle East peace agreement would depend on Israel’s acceptance of a Palestinian state, Mr. Viorst’s vision of the Six-Day War’s impact remains unfulfilled.
993	“It started a process, however halting,” he wrote almost four decades ago, “which still carries a promise of peace in our time between Israel and its other neighbors.”
994	By Eric Lipton, Michael Crowley and John IsmayWASHINGTON — The prospect of growing military threats from both China and Russia is driving bipartisan support for a surge in Pentagon spending, setting up another potential boom for weapons makers that is likely to extend beyond the war in Ukraine.Congress is on track in the coming week to give final approval to a national military budget for the current fiscal year that is expected to reach approximately $858 billion — or $45 billion above what President Biden had requested.If approved at this level, the Pentagon budget will have grown at 4.3 percent per year over the last two years — even after inflation — compared with an average of less than 1 percent a year in real dollars between 2015 and 2021, according to an analysis by Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments for The New York Times.Spending on procurement would rise sharply next year, including a 55 percent jump in Army funding to buy new missiles and a 47 percent jump for the Navy’s weapons purchases.On Friday, Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden’s national security adviser, put the buildup in strategic terms, saying the war in Ukraine had exposed shortfalls in the nation’s military industrial base that needed to be addressed to ensure the United States is “able to support Ukraine and to be able to deal with contingencies elsewhere in the world.”Lockheed Martin, the nation’s largest military contractor, had booked more than $950 million worth of its own missile military orders from the Pentagon in part to refill stockpiles being used in Ukraine. 
995	The Army has awarded Raytheon Technologies more than $2 billion in contracts to deliver missile systems to expand or replenish weapons used to help Ukraine.
996	“We went through six years of Stingers in 10 months,” Gregory J. Hayes, Raytheon’s chief executive, said in an interview earlier this month, referring to 1,600 of the company’s shoulder-fired antiaircraft missiles sent by the U.S. government to Ukraine. 
997	“So it will take us multiple years to restock and replenish.”But those contracts are just the leading edge of what is shaping up to be a big new defense buildup. 
998	Military spending next year is on track to reach its highest level in inflation-adjusted terms since the peaks in the costs of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars between 2008 and 2011, and the second highest in inflation-adjusted terms since World War II — a level that is more than the budgets for the next 10 largest cabinet agencies combined.Even more orders are coming in to military contractors from U.S. allies in Europe and Asia, as they too have concluded they must do more to arm themselves against rising global threats. 
999	Japan moved this month to double its spending on defense over the next five years, putting aside a pacifist stand it has largely maintained since 1945.And none of this counts an estimated $18 billion of planned but now delayed weapons deliveries by the United States to arm Taiwan against a possible future attack by China.The combination of the Ukraine war and the growing consensus about the emergence of a new era of superpower confrontation is prompting efforts to ensure the military industrial base can respond to surges in demand. 
1000	The issue has become urgent in some cases as the U.S. and its NATO allies seek to keep weapons flowing to Ukraine without diminishing their own stocks to worrisome levels.The Ukrainian military has run through years’ worth of the missile production capacity of Western suppliers in a matter of months. 
1001	At the same time, contractors remain concerned about investing to meet growing demand for weapons that could dry up again when the war ends or politics shifts course.
1002	“The difficulty of starting a production line back up, that doesn’t come for free,” Tom Arseneault, president of BAE Systems, which is now considering restarting its M777 howitzer manufacturing line, which the company had been in the process of shutting down. 
1003	The M777 is a highly accurate, towed gun that fires 155-millimeter artillery shells, which are also in diminishing supply.The annual military authorization bill that passed the Senate on Thursday prevents the Air Force and Navy from retiring aging weapons systems that the military would like to take out of service, including certain C-130 transport planes or F-22 fighter jets. 
1004	At the same time, it includes billions of dollars in extra money to build even more new ships and planes than the Pentagon itself asked for, including $2.2 billion alone for an extra Navy-guided missile destroyer, according to the Senate Armed Services Committee.And there is $678 million to expand ammunition plants in spots such as Scranton, Pa.
1005	; Middletown, Iowa; and Kingsport, Tenn., where contractors work with the Army to manufacture the ammunition that Ukrainian artillery crews have burned through at an alarming rate. 
1006	(The money for these programs is expected to be included in a huge appropriations bill that appears to be on track to pass Congress and signed into law by Mr. Biden by the end of the week.)Spending could be even higher, as Congress is also considering a request for an extra $21.7 billion for the Pentagon, above the already expanded 2023 annual budget, to allocate more money to resupply materials used in Ukraine.In an indication of how government policy is shifting to rebuild industrial capacity for the military, Congress this year has moved to allow the Defense Department to more broadly make multiyear spending commitments for certain weapons systems and shipbuilding operations. 
1007	That is a provision that industry lobbyists have long pushed for, arguing it gives companies certainty that investments they make to start production will see continued returns in future years.
1008	“We have to make a commitment with the industry,” said Senator Deb Fischer, Republican of Nebraska and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who supported the change. 
1009	“Then the industry will step forward to restart or grow their production lines.”That move alone suggests $73 billion in additional munitions orders could be on the way in the next three years, contracts that will largely benefit the big players like Lockheed and Raytheon, according to an analysis by Myles Walton, a military industry analyst at Wolfe Research, a Wall Street research firm.These trends help explain stock market performance of the major military contractors — a small group of which control the bulk of sales to the Pentagon. 
1010	Lockheed and Northrop Grumman both have seen their stock prices jump more than 35 percent so far this year in a market whose main indexes are down overall for the year.Opponents of higher military budgets say they are frustrated.Military contractors are “riding high again, and Ukraine just gives them another argument as to why things need to continue onward and upward,” said William D. Hartung, a fellow at the non-interventionist Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft.
1011	“The trillion-dollar defense budget — that is where we are headed,” said Lawrence J. Korb, who served as an assistant defense secretary during the Reagan administration and was once a vice president at Raytheon. 
1012	“Nobody seems to want to make the tough choices. Even the Democrats now seem to be afraid to be seen as being soft on defense.”The biggest barrier for growth for major military contractors — the list includes Lockheed, Raytheon, Boeing, General Dynamics, BAE, Northrop Grumman and Huntington Ingalls Industries — is finding sufficient supplies of key components, such as microelectronics and missile warheads, as well as a steady supply of new employees to assemble all these items.
1013	“You cannot throw much more money at the seven shipbuilders that build U.S. warships in the United States of America right now,” Adm. Michael M. Gilday, the chief of naval operations, said this month during the Reagan National Defense Forum in California, referring to a $32.6 billion shipbuilding budget in the military authorization bill that is $4.7 billion more than the Pentagon requested. 
1014	“Their capacity is about at max. And Congress is helping us max them out.”Raytheon, which has 180,000 workers, has hired 27,000 new employees so far this year, its chief executive said in October. 
1015	But even with that, it is still running into bottlenecks in terms of available parts and labor shortages that are slowing sales, its executives said.The sheer scale of the munitions and missiles sent to Ukraine illustrates just how much matériel a war can consume.That includes more than 104 million rounds of small-arms ammunition, at least one million rounds of 155-millimeter artillery shells, 46,000 anti-tank weapons, more than 1,600 Stinger antiaircraft missiles and 8,500 Javelin anti-armor missiles, according to a Pentagon tally.The resupply challenge is not just a matter of money. 
1016	Military contractors have nearly stopped manufacturing Stingers — Raytheon’s last contract from the U.S. government was in 2002, Mr. Haynes said. 
1017	And while Javelins are still being made jointly by Raytheon and Lockheed — in September they were awarded a $311 million contract to deliver more of them — historically they have been able to make only about 2,100 a year, or about a quarter of what Ukraine has burned through since the outbreak of the war in February.In total, the Pentagon as of early December had awarded at least $6 billion to military contractors to resupply these and other items sent to Ukraine.
1018	“We’re going to ramp up,” Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said this month. 
1019	“We’ve really been working closely with industry to both increase their capacity and also the speed at which they’re able to produce.”The overall spending on national defense still remains relatively low as a percentage of the nation’s economy: about 3.2 percent of the gross domestic product this year, compared to 37 percent during World War II and 13 percent during the Korean War, according to Pentagon records.Still, companies are scrambling to avoid or resolve bottlenecks caused by the increase in demand.Lockheed, for example, spent more than $60 million of its own money in advance of getting Pentagon contract commitment to build more of its High Mobility Artillery Rocket System vehicles, or HIMARS, which fire guided rockets carrying 200 pounds of explosives that can hit targets nearly 50 miles away. 
1020	The vehicles have been much sought after by Ukraine, which has used them to devastating effect against the Russians.Traditionally, Lockheed has been able to build 60 of these trucks per year, but it is now shifting production to 24 hours a day and seven days a week in an effort to bring that annual total to 96 units. 
1021	It also now has a new $430 million contract to deliver more HIMARS, along with a new $521 million contract to build more of the rockets, called GMLRS, that these vehicles can fire.These resupply orders, while large in terms of many other contracts the federal government issues, are still relatively small for the biggest contractors. 
1022	At Lockheed, for example, about 70 percent of sales come from the U.S. government, and most of the rest from other governments worldwide. 
1023	Supply chain and labor shortage problems are cutting into sales and profits, including at Lockheed, which expects to see annual sales decline this year to $62.3 billion from $67 billion.
1024	“The clutch is engaging but into some lower gears initially,” James Taiclet, Lockheed’s chief executive, said in October, adding that higher sales might not show up for another year.But there are more of the big-ticket orders coming. 
1025	In the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Switzerland and Germany have both moved in recent months to finalize orders for the F-35 fighter jets, collectively worth $16 billion. 
1026	Overall foreign military sales notifications to Congress so far in 2022 have totaled $81 billion, the third highest figure in the last 25 years, with an increasing share of these sales going to European and Asian nations.Next year’s military budget also includes major investments in new hypersonic weapons that are also being aggressively pursued by China. 
1027	Raytheon and Northrop Grumman in September won a $1 billion contract just to build prototypes for the Air Force.Other companies want to replace older equipment sent to Ukraine with newer models. 
1028	BAE, for example, intends to sell the Army more armored vehicles called AMPVs, in place of the more than 200 of BAE’s Vietnam-era M113 armored personnel carriers sent to Ukraine, which it no longer makes.
1029	“Nothing’s cheap, right?” said Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro  this month at the conference in California, as he ran through many new investments the Navy is making. 
1030	“Nothing’s free.”Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.
1031	When Chris Licht told his boss, Stephen Colbert, the host of the CBS program “Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” in February that he had been offered the chief executive job at CNN, Mr. Colbert was blunt: “Definitely don’t go do that.”But for Mr. Licht, nothing less than democracy itself was at stake. 
1032	He argued he could make CNN a news channel that people trusted, as opposed to one that monetized partisan combat.
1033	“Oh, man, you used to be in news, remember?” 
1034	Mr. Colbert recalled telling him. 
1035	“You said this was so much nicer — 12 weeks off, good pay, laugh for an hour every night. Everyone is really nice; you can say anything you want, and nobody leaks it. It’s great.”“CNN would be lucky to get you,” Mr. Colbert continued. 
1036	“But you’re my friend, and I’m telling you not to go.”“This is a calling,” Mr. Licht countered.At which point Mr. Colbert stopped trying to dissuade him: “I can’t negotiate with a calling.”On Feb. 28, Mr. Licht was named CNN’s new chief executive. 
1037	Since then, he and Mr. Colbert have spoken nearly every Friday. 
1038	Each time, Mr. Colbert begins with the same four words:“I told you so.”By almost any measure, Mr. Licht, 51, has had a rough start. 
1039	His first major act was to kill the network’s fledgling streaming service, CNN+, and fire 400 or so people working on it. 
1040	CNN’s revenue and profits have plunged to a projected $750 million this year, down from $1.25 billion last year, partly from the costs associated with CNN+, the network acknowledged. 
1041	CNN’s ratings declined, on average, this year compared with 2021, according to Nielsen, with CNN falling behind MSNBC for the first time in prime time on election night among total viewers. 
1042	(CNN prevailed in the coveted 25-to-54 age group.)At the end of November, Mr. Licht levied another round of job cuts — this time just under 10 percent of CNN’s work force of about 4,000, which plunged morale further. 
1043	Among the casualties were familiar commentators like Chris Cillizza, key behind-the-scenes producers with decades of experience, and the entirety of HLN, CNN’s sister network, and its popular morning host, Robin Meade.A chorus of media pundits has pounced on every tidbit of bad news. 
1044	Mr. Licht’s early programming efforts aimed at repositioning the network as broader and less partisan have prompted howls of criticism, with former MSNBC host and former colleague Keith Olbermann publicly calling Mr. Licht a “TV Fascist” after he moved Don Lemon, a liberal host, from a prime-time slot to a revamped morning show.
1045	“The uninformed vitriol, especially from the left, has been stunning,” Mr. Licht said in one of several interviews with The New York Times spanning his nearly eight-month tenure. 
1046	“Which proves my point: so much of what passes for news is name-calling, half-truths and desperation.”Mr. 
1047	Licht said he was under no illusion that stepping into the chief executive job would be easy or make him popular. 
1048	The network’s previous parent, the telecommunications giant AT&T, had just spun off its Warner Media subsidiary, which included CNN, into a new company run by Discovery’s chief executive, David Zaslav.Just two months before the companies merged and only weeks before CNN+ was introduced to the world, the network’s popular and longtime chief executive, Jeff Zucker, was forced to resign after failing to disclose a romantic relationship with his top lieutenant, Allison Gollust. 
1049	Some at CNN felt Mr. Zucker had been unfairly sacrificed and remained staunchly loyal to their former boss.CNN had also become the poster child for the poisoned relationship between former President Donald J. Trump and mainstream media organizations. 
1050	Mr. Trump repeatedly branded CNN as “fake news,” and his administration engaged in open warfare with CNN correspondents like Jim Acosta, whom Mr. Trump once called “a rude, terrible person” during a news conference. 
1051	In 2018, CNN’s New York headquarters had to be evacuated after a bomb threat.CNN remained enviably profitable, earning over $1 billion a year for the past five years. 
1052	But cable news, along with all cable channels, has been in secular decline, troubled by shifting viewer habits in an era of cord cutting and an exodus to streaming services and online news sites.It’s not clear anyone could surmount those challenges, let alone someone who’d just spent nearly six years at a late-night entertainment show and had never managed a complex, globe-spanning organization with thousands of employees.So why even take the job?
1053	Mr. 
1054	Licht seemed to have TV news in his DNA. 
1055	As a child, he’d created a fictional TV news network, WBC, and produced his own newscast using a VCR camera in his basement in Newtown, Conn. 
1056	At about the age of 9, he met the NBC legal correspondent Carl Stern on a family vacation and, in Mr. Licht’s telling, “stuck to him like glue.” 
1057	Mr. Licht pried the newsman’s phone number from him and used it regularly. 
1058	“I was obsessed,” Mr. Licht said. 
1059	After college at Syracuse University, Mr. Licht landed jobs at NBC affiliates in Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
1060	As a reporter and producer, he covered a mass shooting in San Bernardino, the plane crash that killed John F. Kennedy Jr., two presidential campaigns and three Olympics.In 2005, he moved to NBC’s sibling network, MSNBC, soon becoming an executive producer for “Morning Joe,” which he helped develop into an improbable success in its hotly competitive morning time slot. 
1061	Notably, the two hosts, the former Republican politician Joe Scarborough and the more liberal former CBS correspondent Mika Brzezinski, straddled the political divide. 
1062	The tension between them seemed to enhance their audience appeal. 
1063	Mr. Licht encouraged them to be themselves and embrace the unexpected. 
1064	(They later married.)Mr. 
1065	Licht moved to CBS in 2010, where he’d scored another early morning success. 
1066	He lifted ratings at the perennial also-ran “CBS This Morning” on the strength of the program’s three hosts, Charlie Rose, Gayle King and Norah O’Donnell, and an emphasis on news and in-depth interviews, rather than the lighter fare format of its competitors “Today” and “Good Morning America.”After having a brain aneurysm in 2010 when he was still under 40, Mr. Licht wrote a book about what he learned from the experience, while still describing himself as a “killer TV producer” with “no urge to surrender my spot in the fast lane,” even after the near-fatal incident.Restless after six years at “This Morning,” in 2016 he joined the then-faltering CBS program “Late Show With Stephen Colbert.” 
1067	Within a year, Mr. Colbert had seized the late-night ratings crown from Jimmy Fallon of NBC’s “Tonight Show.”Soon after the Warner-Discovery deal was announced, Mr. Zaslav summoned Mr. Licht to Discovery’s headquarters in Manhattan on 19th Street and asked what he thought of CNN.Mr. 
1068	Licht told him he had no interest in running it. 
1069	“I got out of news, and I’m not going back,” Mr. Licht had insisted.Mr. 
1070	Zaslav ignored the demurral. 
1071	Over the next several weeks, he kept making the case to Mr. Licht. 
1072	In fact, Mr. Zaslav said in an interview that he never considered anyone else for the job.The two men have known each other for 15 years, since both were working at NBC, where Mr. Zaslav helped start MSNBC. 
1073	In the years since, they have had breakfast once a quarter. 
1074	Mr. Licht has looked to Mr. Zaslav as a mentor, and Mr. Zaslav has admired Mr. Licht’s work ethic and drive.
1075	“He’s a fighter, and he likes to win,” Mr. Zaslav said.At their first meeting, Mr. Zaslav argued that running CNN would be “a great opportunity to build the No. 1 news brand in the world,” and “the most trusted brand in news where people go every day and in a crisis for the best version of the truth.”And more than that: “This is important for America. It’s important for a functioning society.”Mr. 
1076	Licht and Mr. Zaslav — not to mention Warner’s largest shareholder, the media mogul John Malone — were philosophically aligned. 
1077	Fox and MSNBC were “advocacy” networks, as Mr. Zaslav put it, a proven business model appealing to like-minded viewers but of scant, if any, value as a public service. 
1078	Whether by design or happenstance, he believed CNN had tacked left, a pale version of MSNBC that nonetheless alienated wide parts of the American electorate with a focus on politics and the president at the time, Mr. Trump.Ted Turner’s mantra had always been “the news is the star.” 
1079	Mr. Trump “is not the star,” Mr. Zaslav said.Yet Mr. Licht was noncommittal. 
1080	On a subsequent phone call, Mr. Zaslav urged Mr. Licht to think about CNN and whether he’d be interested in the top job. 
1081	After Mr. Licht hung up, his wife, Jennifer Blanco Licht, a former TV executive herself, asked: “Is this crazy? I think you should do it.”The two men continued the conversation on a long walk in Central Park. 
1082	(They both live near the park.) 
1083	During that conversation, Mr. Zaslav warned Mr. Licht that he’d be closely scrutinized and judged harshly. 
1084	Is your family ready for this? 
1085	Are you ready for this? 
1086	Because “it will be brutal,” Mr. Zaslav said.Mr. 
1087	Licht said he doesn’t recall Mr. Zaslav ever offering him the job, or his accepting it. 
1088	At one point, Mr. Zaslav simply asked, “Who’s your lawyer?” and started acting like Mr. Licht was CNN’s future chief executive. 
1089	A contract ensued.On their first lunch afterward, at Mr. Zaslav’s usual corner table at Gramercy Tavern, Mr. Zaslav indicated their yearslong relationship had fundamentally changed. 
1090	“We’ve been friends for 15 years,” Mr. Zaslav said. 
1091	“We’re not friends any more. You work for me.”Almost immediately, their shared vision of saving democracy ran into the harsh reality of cable news economics.With Fox News and MSNBC having already staked out the right and left ends of the political spectrum, attracting the middle (what Mr. Licht referred to as “normal” people) has proved elusive. 
1092	Mr. Zaslav had stressed that he didn’t care — at least not much — about CNN’s current ratings, revenue or profitability. 
1093	He recognized that it would take years to reposition and rebuild the network. 
1094	But even he had his limits.AT&T’s board had approved an ambitious budget of $350 million for CNN+, much of it already spent by the time Mr. Licht arrived. 
1095	Many more millions would be needed. 
1096	With Warner facing pressure from Wall Street to find $3 billion in savings, on April 21, Mr. Licht killed the streaming service after less than a month on air.In an effort to restore morale and calm anxiety, Mr. Licht assured CNN employees at a network-wide town hall meeting on May 5 that Warner Bros. 
1097	Discovery didn’t anticipate further job cuts at CNN because there was no overlap between the news network and Discovery’s cable channels, and thus there wasn’t anyone else doing the same jobs that would need to be cut. 
1098	In a series of additional town hall meetings, most of them leaked almost immediately to The New York Times and other news outlets, Mr. Licht also laid the groundwork for the network’s shift to broader, less political and less partisan coverage. 
1099	This was not, he stressed repeatedly, a move to the “center,” a boring, political neutral zone that Mr. Licht wasn’t even sure existed. 
1100	Rather, it was an attempt to explore controversial issues from varied perspectives — not to tell people “what to think,” as he put it, but “how to think,” or what he called a “blueprint for how to make decisions.”In July, Mr. Licht made a highly symbolic pilgrimage to Capitol Hill noteworthy for its inclusion of Republicans like the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, and Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas. 
1101	Although he spent equal time with Democratic leaders like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Mr. Licht was irritated that his visit was billed as an “apology tour” and effort to coax Republicans back onto the network — part of CNN’s perceived move to the right.After long absences, several Republicans have since appeared on CNN, including Mr. McCarthy and Senator Rick Scott of Florida.Featuring hosts and guests with opposing points of view and playing up controversy has paid ratings dividends on cable in the past, notably on CNN’s own “Crossfire,” which came under criticism for evolving into to a verbal food fight criticized by the comedian Jon Stewart as “hurting America.”But Mr. Licht said he wasn’t interested in controversy for its own sake, but to offer a “rational conversation about polarizing issues.” 
1102	After watching CNN, he hopes people will “take what they’ve heard to the dinner table and have a discussion,” he said. 
1103	“That’s a dream of mine.”Two examples have been coverage of the abortion debate in the wake of the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade, and the debate over gun rights. 
1104	To vocal criticism from the left, he hired Stephen Gutowski, founder and editor of The Reload, a firearms website. 
1105	No one wants a school shooting, said Mr. Licht, whose hometown, Newtown, was the site of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre. 
1106	“But we have to understand the culture of people who like guns,” he said.
1107	“This is not vanilla, centrist or boring,” he added.Mr. 
1108	Licht has barely begun to put his stamp on the network’s programming, but it’s already evident in the new morning show, “CNN This Morning.” 
1109	Mr. Licht picked the hosts, persuading the left-leaning Don Lemon to trade his prime-time slot for early morning, and pairing him with the former Daily Caller reporter and CNN White House correspondent Kaitlan Collins and Poppy Harlow, a former host of “CNN Newsroom.” 
1110	The show takes a somewhat similar approach to the one he used at “CBS This Morning” (which also shares a near-identical name).
1111	In a series of interviews with The Times, Mr. Licht visibly came to life talking about “This Morning” and its co-hosts. 
1112	“They obviously like each other,” he said. 
1113	“The chemistry is great. I love the collaboration. Every day, it evolves. It’s not like me giving orders. It’s so much fun.”“This Morning” debuted on Nov. 1. 
1114	The New York Post (which shares ownership with CNN’s rival, Fox News) reported the next day that “‘CNN This Morning’ bombs in debut,” drawing just 387,000 viewers, far behind rival morning shows and trailing its predecessor on CNN, “New Day.” 
1115	CNN called the instant critique “absurd and cheap” after just one day’s data. 
1116	(Since then, the show has gained slightly among total viewers.) 
1117	More significantly, Mr. Licht noted, “This Morning” has broken news, including the chief Washington correspondent Jake Tapper’s scoop that Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona was leaving the Democratic Party to become an Independent.Prime time looms as an even greater challenge. 
1118	In August, Mr. Licht moved Mr. Tapper from his 4 p.m. anchor position to the coveted 9 p.m. slot that had been vacated by Chris Cuomo after CNN fired him for what it deemed inappropriate efforts to help his brother, New York’s former governor, Andrew Cuomo, fend off the sexual harassment allegations that led to his resignation from office. 
1119	The experiment with Mr. Tapper fared poorly in the ratings and lasted just one month.Mr. 
1120	Licht acknowledged that prime time remains an “open canvas.” 
1121	He said he and his colleagues were meeting and “throwing things against the wall, looking at off-the-beaten path opportunities.” 
1122	Among the names tossed out have been entertainment, comedy and sports figures. 
1123	He declined to be more specific but promised surprises.Miklos Sarvary, a professor and director of the media and technology program at Columbia Business School, said that entertainment was potentially more profitable than low-margin news. 
1124	“But what does that do to the brand if you want to be the most trusted name in news?” he said. 
1125	“News is supposed to be serious. I’m not sure that putting on a comedian is a great move for credibility.”Mr. 
1126	Licht said he understood Mr. Sarvary’s point, but said prime time offered “some leeway for being a little different.”“It has to be compelling and entertaining without hurting the news brand,” he said, citing his former boss Mr. Colbert, and Mr. Stewart as “the kind of people who’d work,” while acknowledging that Mr. Stewart is already locked into a lucrative contract at Apple TV.Every Saturday, Mr. Licht sends Mr. Zaslav a memo with highlights of the week and programming and financial updates. 
1127	Mr. Licht’s growth strategy is focused on CNN.com, which attracts more than 200 million unique visitors each month, according to CNN. 
1128	But at its peak, CNN digital generated only about 10 percent of the network’s profits, Mr. Licht confirmed.On Oct. 13, Mr. Licht made his debut in front of Warner Brother Discovery’s board at a hotel in Los Angeles, where he outlined both his growth and content strategy. 
1129	Asked about his efforts to make CNN less partisan, Mr. Licht gave this analogy: Suppose it’s raining outside. 
1130	CNN plans to have people on who love the rain, and it will have people on who say they don’t like the rain. 
1131	But it won’t have anyone on who says it’s sunny out.Mr. 
1132	Licht said he used the analogy to make clear that a less-partisan CNN did not mean it was any less committed to truth. 
1133	“This wasn’t to plot a new course but to assure people we would not let up one inch in being truth tellers,” he said. 
1134	“The change is we will not do Trump 24/7 or let him dictate our agenda.”By all accounts, Mr. Licht’s presentation was warmly received by directors, including Mr. Malone.Mr. 
1135	Licht’s vision is contending with industrywide pressures to cut costs. 
1136	(He said he appreciates but doesn’t really believe Mr. Zaslav’s professed indifference to financial results.) 
1137	By announcing the need for more layoffs on Oct. 26, he said he hoped to engage in a “transparent” process that would leave everyone feeling they’d been heard. 
1138	But, he said, “it would be irresponsible not to do the tough work now.” 
1139	He added, “I promise you CNN will be more profitable next year.”However transparent, many in CNN’s rank and file felt blindsided by the cuts, especially after what they perceived as his earlier reassurances that no further layoffs would be needed. 
1140	In a all-staff meeting in November, Mr. Licht said he stood by his earlier remark that there would be no merger-related layoffs, and “I absolutely would not have said something that I did not believe to be true.” 
1141	But he said he understood how his remarks had hurt his credibility. 
1142	“I have to win that credibility back,” he acknowledged.Mr. 
1143	Licht said the firings were the “low point” of his tenure so far.At another all-staff meeting this month, aimed at restoring morale, Mr. Licht took questions and then ended with a passage he wrote himself:In terms of morale, let me just say, you work at a world-renowned news organization alongside the best journalists on the globe. 
1144	Your jobs have meaning. 
1145	Your jobs have an impact. 
1146	You are part of something bigger, of something with tremendous meaning. 
1147	And nothing about that has changed. 
1148	And you have in me as a leader, who has done a lot of your jobs, someone who has your back every step of the way. 
1149	My loyalty is first and foremost to this organization and to journalism without fear or favor to anyone else, including our parent company.That’s why I’m here. 
1150	That’s why I took this job.
1151	“I want CNN to be essential to society,” Mr. Licht said in one of our interviews. 
1152	“If you’re essential then the revenue will follow.”And if it doesn’t?
1153	“Maybe it won’t work,” Mr. Licht conceded. 
1154	“But I’d rather try to win this way.”Benjamin Mullin and Michael M. Grynbaum contributed reporting.
1155	The night before Hubert Davis brought his University of North Carolina men’s basketball team to Madison Square Garden for the first time as a head coach, he showed his players video from a pair of seminal moments from his playing days with the rough and tumble 1990s Knicks: a full-scale melee with the Phoenix Suns and another with the Chicago Bulls that carried into the stands and almost into the lap of David Stern, then the N.B.A. commissioner.
1156	“I told them I don’t want you to get into a brawl, but I just wanted to let you know the experience that I had here,” Davis said of those tinderbox days at the Garden, when the game was far closer to a steel cage match than a night at the ballet.If there was a message — that the Tar Heels would need to fight (metaphorically, at least) for rebounds, dig in on defense and muscle their way to their spots on offense against a young but physical Ohio State team — it largely went unheeded Saturday when North Carolina, which had fallen behind by 14 points in the first half, trudged to halftime trailing by 9.Then Davis was more direct.
1157	“Coach just called us soft,” said Armando Bacot, the Tar Heels’ senior center. 
1158	“In the first half, we were getting punked. We were giving up a lot of offensive rebounds and they were doing what they wanted to do. In the second half, we wanted to lock in and throw some punches.”The Tar Heels found enough resolve — and a dollop of intervention from Pete Nance’s buzzer-beating jumper off an inbounds play at the end of regulation — to deliver an 89-84 overtime victory that carried with it a sigh of relief through the locker room like a December zephyr.
1159	“We kind of needed that,” said RJ Davis, a junior point guard.The game — tense, physical and with many turns — was an exquisite undercard at Madison Square Garden, preceding U.C.L.A.’s methodical disassembling of Kentucky, 63-53, on Saturday night.If the atmosphere at the Garden wasn’t quite as raw as the Big East tournament semifinals on a Friday night in March, it was still lively with North Carolina and Kentucky fans — including Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman sitting courtside — making up most of the crowd of 20,261.The Garden was the epicenter of what felt like a day of taking stock in college basketball. 
1160	Houston won at Virginia, Gonzaga got past Alabama, Kansas throttled Indiana and Arizona survived a visit from Tennessee in a batch of intersectional games that figure to carry weight for the N.C.A.A. tournament selection committee.There is much ground to cover, though, before March.It is hard to find a team for which that distance will feel like more of a slog than North Carolina, which returned almost its entire cast from last season when it perhaps came within a cruel twist — a turn of Bacot’s ankle in the waning moments of the championship game against Kansas — of winning the national title.The Tar Heels began this season ranked No. 1, until they lost four in a row and became the earliest preseason favorite to exit the rankings in more than 50 years.
1161	“It’s not easy; expectations are crazy,” said U.C.L.A. Coach Mick Cronin, who found himself in a similar circumstance a year ago. 
1162	The Bruins squeaked into the N.C.A.A. tournament in 2021, just as North Carolina did last season, and lost in devastating fashion in the Final Four, on a halfcourt shot by Gonzaga’s Jalen Suggs.Cronin returned his entire rotation last season — and added two role players — but the Bruins, who began last season ranked No. 2, never quite found that same level and were bounced from the tournament by North Carolina in a regional semifinal.
1163	“I felt like last year my thing was, we were — you can’t just wait until March like we’re going to come back and try and win it,” Cronin said. 
1164	He added: “It’s just human nature. It’s not that the kids don’t care. It’s not that they don’t try, but it’s kind of like, ‘We want to get back.’”In Cronin’s estimation, in programs like his — or at North Carolina, Kentucky or any of the other basketball elites — it’s rarely a question of having enough offensive talent, but of doing the uncomfortable things that separate the best teams from merely the most talented.
1165	“You’ve got to eat your vegetables,” he said.The Bruins may have required an extra helping of spinach against Kentucky center Oscar Tshiebwe, who managed just 8 points but grabbed 16 rebounds and drew seven fouls, and got so little help from his teammates that it conjured up memories of last season’s tournament flameout against St. Peter’s.It was clear how much the game meant to the Bruins when Jaylen Clark roared after a late breakaway dunk, when Tyger Campbell spiked the ball when the buzzer sounded and when the Bruins high-fived a pocket of their fans as they bounced off the court.U.C.L.A.’s Jaime Jaquez Jr., who carried his team with 19 points, 12 rebounds, 4 assists and 4 steals, had circled the game when the schedule came out, as much for the setting as the opponent.
1166	“The city is amazing,” said Jaquez, who grew up in Camarillo, Calif., but whose only sports memory in a handful of visits to New York was watching one of Mariano Rivera’s final games at Yankee Stadium. 
1167	“Every time I come is always an adventure.”Players from far and near seemed to relish the experience.Just as enthralled was RJ Davis, the North Carolina guard, who grew up north of the city in White Plains, N.Y. He won a state championship at Archbishop Stepinac High School, but playoff games were played at Fordham and St. John’s.
1168	“I couldn’t lose in my own city,” said Davis, who hit four clinching free throws in overtime and a critical 3-pointer among his 21 points, 8 rebounds and 4 assists. 
1169	“I’ve loved watching the games here ever since I was a kid; it’s the mecca.”The day was not without its moments for another pair of locals. 
1170	Ohio State’s Zed Key, a junior forward from Bay Shore, N.Y., hit a 3-pointer with 30 seconds left to put the Buckeyes ahead. 
1171	And U.C.L.A.’s Mac Etienne, who grew up in Manhattan, played a useful 13 minutes by picking up five rebounds.The day, though, belonged mostly to Nance, the graduate transfer from Northwestern and the only new component of the North Carolina rotation. 
1172	If his father, Larry Nance, and his brother, Larry Jr., have their own Garden memories from the N.B.A., he has one, too.It looked grim for North Carolina after the Ohio State freshman Brice Sensabaugh’s jumper in the lane had put the Buckeyes ahead, 79-77, with two seconds left in regulation.North Carolina called a timeout, and Leaky Black fired a pass to midcourt to Davis, who called another timeout with 1.2 seconds left. 
1173	That set up a more delicate pass from Black, who lofted the ball to the other side of the lane to Nance, a play they had never practiced. 
1174	“I used to play a little quarterback back in the day,” Black said with a smile.Nance gathered the ball, wheeled and lofted a turnaround 18-footer that left his fingertips with one-tenth of a second left. 
1175	The ball settled through the net to tie the game, bringing the Garden to its feet. 
1176	It gave the Tar Heels a chance at redemption in overtime — and a taste of what lies ahead in the distance of a college basketball season.
1177	By Eric Lipton, Michael Crowley and John IsmayWASHINGTON — The prospect of growing military threats from both China and Russia is driving bipartisan support for a surge in Pentagon spending, setting up another potential boom for weapons makers that is likely to extend beyond the war in Ukraine.Congress is on track in the coming week to give final approval to a national military budget for the current fiscal year that is expected to reach approximately $858 billion — or $45 billion above what President Biden had requested.If approved at this level, the Pentagon budget will have grown at 4.3 percent per year over the last two years — even after inflation — compared with an average of less than 1 percent a year in real dollars between 2015 and 2021, according to an analysis by Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments for The New York Times.Spending on procurement would rise sharply next year, including a 55 percent jump in Army funding to buy new missiles and a 47 percent jump for the Navy’s weapons purchases.On Friday, Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden’s national security adviser, put the buildup in strategic terms, saying the war in Ukraine had exposed shortfalls in the nation’s military industrial base that needed to be addressed to ensure the United States is “able to support Ukraine and to be able to deal with contingencies elsewhere in the world.”Lockheed Martin, the nation’s largest military contractor, had booked more than $950 million worth of its own missile military orders from the Pentagon in part to refill stockpiles being used in Ukraine. 
1178	The Army has awarded Raytheon Technologies more than $2 billion in contracts to deliver missile systems to expand or replenish weapons used to help Ukraine.
1179	“We went through six years of Stingers in 10 months,” Gregory J. Hayes, Raytheon’s chief executive, said in an interview earlier this month, referring to 1,600 of the company’s shoulder-fired antiaircraft missiles sent by the U.S. government to Ukraine. 
1180	“So it will take us multiple years to restock and replenish.”But those contracts are just the leading edge of what is shaping up to be a big new defense buildup. 
1181	Military spending next year is on track to reach its highest level in inflation-adjusted terms since the peaks in the costs of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars between 2008 and 2011, and the second highest in inflation-adjusted terms since World War II — a level that is more than the budgets for the next 10 largest cabinet agencies combined.Even more orders are coming in to military contractors from U.S. allies in Europe and Asia, as they too have concluded they must do more to arm themselves against rising global threats. 
1182	Japan moved this month to double its spending on defense over the next five years, putting aside a pacifist stand it has largely maintained since 1945.And none of this counts an estimated $18 billion of planned but now delayed weapons deliveries by the United States to arm Taiwan against a possible future attack by China.The combination of the Ukraine war and the growing consensus about the emergence of a new era of superpower confrontation is prompting efforts to ensure the military industrial base can respond to surges in demand. 
1183	The issue has become urgent in some cases as the U.S. and its NATO allies seek to keep weapons flowing to Ukraine without diminishing their own stocks to worrisome levels.The Ukrainian military has run through years’ worth of the missile production capacity of Western suppliers in a matter of months. 
1184	At the same time, contractors remain concerned about investing to meet growing demand for weapons that could dry up again when the war ends or politics shifts course.
1185	“The difficulty of starting a production line back up, that doesn’t come for free,” Tom Arseneault, president of BAE Systems, which is now considering restarting its M777 howitzer manufacturing line, which the company had been in the process of shutting down. 
1186	The M777 is a highly accurate, towed gun that fires 155-millimeter artillery shells, which are also in diminishing supply.The annual military authorization bill that passed the Senate on Thursday prevents the Air Force and Navy from retiring aging weapons systems that the military would like to take out of service, including certain C-130 transport planes or F-22 fighter jets. 
1187	At the same time, it includes billions of dollars in extra money to build even more new ships and planes than the Pentagon itself asked for, including $2.2 billion alone for an extra Navy-guided missile destroyer, according to the Senate Armed Services Committee.And there is $678 million to expand ammunition plants in spots such as Scranton, Pa.
1188	; Middletown, Iowa; and Kingsport, Tenn., where contractors work with the Army to manufacture the ammunition that Ukrainian artillery crews have burned through at an alarming rate. 
1189	(The money for these programs is expected to be included in a huge appropriations bill that appears to be on track to pass Congress and signed into law by Mr. Biden by the end of the week.)Spending could be even higher, as Congress is also considering a request for an extra $21.7 billion for the Pentagon, above the already expanded 2023 annual budget, to allocate more money to resupply materials used in Ukraine.In an indication of how government policy is shifting to rebuild industrial capacity for the military, Congress this year has moved to allow the Defense Department to more broadly make multiyear spending commitments for certain weapons systems and shipbuilding operations. 
1190	That is a provision that industry lobbyists have long pushed for, arguing it gives companies certainty that investments they make to start production will see continued returns in future years.
1191	“We have to make a commitment with the industry,” said Senator Deb Fischer, Republican of Nebraska and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who supported the change. 
1192	“Then the industry will step forward to restart or grow their production lines.”That move alone suggests $73 billion in additional munitions orders could be on the way in the next three years, contracts that will largely benefit the big players like Lockheed and Raytheon, according to an analysis by Myles Walton, a military industry analyst at Wolfe Research, a Wall Street research firm.These trends help explain stock market performance of the major military contractors — a small group of which control the bulk of sales to the Pentagon. 
1193	Lockheed and Northrop Grumman both have seen their stock prices jump more than 35 percent so far this year in a market whose main indexes are down overall for the year.Opponents of higher military budgets say they are frustrated.Military contractors are “riding high again, and Ukraine just gives them another argument as to why things need to continue onward and upward,” said William D. Hartung, a fellow at the non-interventionist Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft.
1194	“The trillion-dollar defense budget — that is where we are headed,” said Lawrence J. Korb, who served as an assistant defense secretary during the Reagan administration and was once a vice president at Raytheon. 
1195	“Nobody seems to want to make the tough choices. Even the Democrats now seem to be afraid to be seen as being soft on defense.”The biggest barrier for growth for major military contractors — the list includes Lockheed, Raytheon, Boeing, General Dynamics, BAE, Northrop Grumman and Huntington Ingalls Industries — is finding sufficient supplies of key components, such as microelectronics and missile warheads, as well as a steady supply of new employees to assemble all these items.
1196	“You cannot throw much more money at the seven shipbuilders that build U.S. warships in the United States of America right now,” Adm. Michael M. Gilday, the chief of naval operations, said this month during the Reagan National Defense Forum in California, referring to a $32.6 billion shipbuilding budget in the military authorization bill that is $4.7 billion more than the Pentagon requested. 
1197	“Their capacity is about at max. And Congress is helping us max them out.”Raytheon, which has 180,000 workers, has hired 27,000 new employees so far this year, its chief executive said in October. 
1198	But even with that, it is still running into bottlenecks in terms of available parts and labor shortages that are slowing sales, its executives said.The sheer scale of the munitions and missiles sent to Ukraine illustrates just how much matériel a war can consume.That includes more than 104 million rounds of small-arms ammunition, at least one million rounds of 155-millimeter artillery shells, 46,000 anti-tank weapons, more than 1,600 Stinger antiaircraft missiles and 8,500 Javelin anti-armor missiles, according to a Pentagon tally.The resupply challenge is not just a matter of money. 
1199	Military contractors have nearly stopped manufacturing Stingers — Raytheon’s last contract from the U.S. government was in 2002, Mr. Haynes said. 
1200	And while Javelins are still being made jointly by Raytheon and Lockheed — in September they were awarded a $311 million contract to deliver more of them — historically they have been able to make only about 2,100 a year, or about a quarter of what Ukraine has burned through since the outbreak of the war in February.In total, the Pentagon as of early December had awarded at least $6 billion to military contractors to resupply these and other items sent to Ukraine.
1201	“We’re going to ramp up,” Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said this month. 
1202	“We’ve really been working closely with industry to both increase their capacity and also the speed at which they’re able to produce.”The overall spending on national defense still remains relatively low as a percentage of the nation’s economy: about 3.2 percent of the gross domestic product this year, compared to 37 percent during World War II and 13 percent during the Korean War, according to Pentagon records.Still, companies are scrambling to avoid or resolve bottlenecks caused by the increase in demand.Lockheed, for example, spent more than $60 million of its own money in advance of getting Pentagon contract commitment to build more of its High Mobility Artillery Rocket System vehicles, or HIMARS, which fire guided rockets carrying 200 pounds of explosives that can hit targets nearly 50 miles away. 
1203	The vehicles have been much sought after by Ukraine, which has used them to devastating effect against the Russians.Traditionally, Lockheed has been able to build 60 of these trucks per year, but it is now shifting production to 24 hours a day and seven days a week in an effort to bring that annual total to 96 units. 
1204	It also now has a new $430 million contract to deliver more HIMARS, along with a new $521 million contract to build more of the rockets, called GMLRS, that these vehicles can fire.These resupply orders, while large in terms of many other contracts the federal government issues, are still relatively small for the biggest contractors. 
1205	At Lockheed, for example, about 70 percent of sales come from the U.S. government, and most of the rest from other governments worldwide. 
1206	Supply chain and labor shortage problems are cutting into sales and profits, including at Lockheed, which expects to see annual sales decline this year to $62.3 billion from $67 billion.
1207	“The clutch is engaging but into some lower gears initially,” James Taiclet, Lockheed’s chief executive, said in October, adding that higher sales might not show up for another year.But there are more of the big-ticket orders coming. 
1208	In the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Switzerland and Germany have both moved in recent months to finalize orders for the F-35 fighter jets, collectively worth $16 billion. 
1209	Overall foreign military sales notifications to Congress so far in 2022 have totaled $81 billion, the third highest figure in the last 25 years, with an increasing share of these sales going to European and Asian nations.Next year’s military budget also includes major investments in new hypersonic weapons that are also being aggressively pursued by China. 
1210	Raytheon and Northrop Grumman in September won a $1 billion contract just to build prototypes for the Air Force.Other companies want to replace older equipment sent to Ukraine with newer models. 
1211	BAE, for example, intends to sell the Army more armored vehicles called AMPVs, in place of the more than 200 of BAE’s Vietnam-era M113 armored personnel carriers sent to Ukraine, which it no longer makes.
1212	“Nothing’s cheap, right?” said Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro  this month at the conference in California, as he ran through many new investments the Navy is making. 
1213	“Nothing’s free.”Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.
1214	The Russian soldier was named Dmitri Tsvigun. 
1215	A table tennis coach from a small city in Siberia, he had volunteered to fight in Ukraine. 
1216	But at age 30, he died from shrapnel wounds when a tank shell exploded near him in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk Province on Nov. 20.“He responded to a call from his heart to join the special military operation,” said a short memorial article in a local newspaper on Dec. 8. 
1217	That brief account got Mr. Tsvigun added to a list of confirmed Russian war deaths maintained by a small, dedicated team of data journalists and volunteers, as the Kremlin has largely avoided updating the number publicly. 
1218	Run by Mediazona, the independent Russian news outlet, with the BBC’s Russian service and about a dozen anonymous volunteers in Russia, the list pulls information from sources like newspaper articles, photographs on tombstones, fellow soldiers mourning their comrades and even tips from relatives who want their loved ones included in the tally.The list has surpassed 10,000 names, including more than 400 Russians drafted recently.
1219	“If the Russian government does not count Russian casualties, then someone has to do it,” said David Frenkel, one of four data reporters from Mediazona running the project. 
1220	“It is important for us to explain to Russians the cost of the war,” he added. 
1221	“If they do not understand the cost from the pictures of devastated Ukrainian cities, then maybe the number of dead Russians will make them think about it.”The Russian government has tried to avoid just that by barely mentioning the death toll from the war it launched with the invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. 
1222	It has updated the number exactly twice: once at the end of March and again in September, when the defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, said that 5,937 Russian troops had been killed since the war started.That official number is notably smaller than estimates from Western military and intelligence officials. 
1223	Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for example, said in November that Moscow’s casualties were “well over 100,000 Russian soldiers killed and wounded.”There have been similar estimates for Ukrainian losses, with Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky, telling a Ukrainian news station this month that up to 13,000 Ukrainian troops had died in the conflict.With so much fog of war shrouding the subject, Mediazona decided that online sleuthing was needed to establish a baseline of Russian deaths. 
1224	A scattered group of volunteers in Russia was already trying to document the deaths on their own, and the BBC News Russian service had done several articles on the subject, so they combined forces.They did not set out to document every death, and estimated that their Russian count was about one-third to half the true total. 
1225	But by harvesting as much information as was available from social media posts and putting a name to every death listed, they figured their number was better than an estimate.
1226	“It is not just about the number; it is about who died or how they died,” said Maxim Litavrin, another data journalist at Mediazona.Ukrainians upload a higgledy-piggledy stream of information about Russians killed in the war on several channels on the Telegram messaging application, including the names of the deceased. 
1227	The team of volunteer investigators in Russia then search social media posts for the names. 
1228	All the information from open sources ends up on a huge spreadsheet. 
1229	The journalists work quickly to check the links and to back up everything because personal posts often disappear. 
1230	They crosscheck names against a government website that lists people deceased throughout Russia but that does not specify military deaths.Seven out of 10 confirmations come from local news reports, the data journalists said, while the others are a mix. 
1231	They include announcements from local officials or employers; individual posts on VKontakte, the Russian equivalent of Facebook; and sources like pictures of memorial plaques put up in dead soldiers’ former schools.Every two weeks, Mediazona crunches all the numbers to break down the toll on its website, including deaths by region, military unit and age.The results can vary drastically by region. 
1232	In Dagestan, Russia, for example, where serving and dying in the Russian Army is considered an honor, officials tend to make statements about those killed.In some regions like Krasnodar, volunteers have counted hundreds of war dead by visiting cemeteries. 
1233	Even temporary tombstones in Russian cemeteries usually include a picture of the deceased, along with the name, military unit, date of birth and date of death.
1234	“Cemeteries give us a lot,” Mr. Frenkel said.Military analysts have mixed views on the project. 
1235	Some prefer to work with estimates of the overall number killed rather than a slice of the total. 
1236	Others stressed that the work had been especially helpful in identifying patterns.
1237	“The project is a useful snapshot of the breakdowns and wider patterns in Russian losses,” said Karolina Hird, a Russia analyst at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War. 
1238	“We know that Russian authorities are simply not presenting truthful reporting on losses.”One early pattern, for example, showed that about 20 percent of Russia’s war deaths were officers. 
1239	“That told us a lot about how the Russian Army operates,” said Olga Ivshina, a reporter with the BBC Russian service who alternates with Mediazona each week to tally the numbers. 
1240	It turned out that senior Russian officers were initially deployed near the front lines because junior officers could not issue orders.The information available online varies widely.A local community page posted pictures showing Alexander A. Dementov, 28, and Alexander Trokhov, 38, after they were drafted at the end of September. 
1241	They were both workers at the Nadezhdinski Metallurgical Plant in Serov, a Russian city in the Urals. 
1242	Then, a local newspaper reported on Dec. 7 that both men, who had served in the 55th motorized rifle brigade, died in a missile strike on Nov. 23.Sometimes, the details are sparse.Vsevolod Matveev was No. 10,000 on the spreadsheet. 
1243	The data journalists discovered that he was from the Sverdlovsk region in the Urals and that he was buried on Dec. 9 in the town of Zarechny. 
1244	From his picture, they could tell that he had served with a motorized infantry unit. 
1245	But that was it.When deaths cannot be confirmed by open sources, the names are put on a side list awaiting further details. 
1246	The Mediazona reporters noted that resistance to the wars in Afghanistan and Chechnya developed in tandem with the death toll, but there has been little sign of that in Russia.Spending every day scrolling through information about dead people is mentally taxing, they said, but certain posts stick with them. 
1247	Mr. Litavrin remembers reading about a 40-year-old man who had a quiet, regular life and a daughter, and volunteered in August. 
1248	He was killed after two weeks on the battlefield.
1249	“I wondered what he was thinking,” Mr. Litavrin said. 
1250	“It’s terrible.”
1251	ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. — The referee warned the Buffalo Bills fans inside Highmark Stadium as if he were a teacher scolding schoolchildren at recess.If their flying snowballs hit a Miami Dolphins player during live action, the referee said, the Bills would be penalized 15 yards. 
1252	Security guards in neon yellow jackets had already migrated toward the Miami bench to dissuade fans from pelting the players and coaches there. 
1253	The large video monitor over the end zone also repeated the message.
1254	“That was great,” Bills safety Jordan Poyer said in a postgame news conference Saturday. 
1255	“That was the first time I had ever heard that.”The intensity of the Bills fans highlighted the increased stakes of the contest, as the divisional rivals jockeyed for playoff seeding in the loaded A.F.C. The Bills won the game, 32-29, clinching a playoff berth and edging closer toward home-field advantage throughout the postseason. 
1256	It is the fifth time in Coach Sean McDermott’s six seasons at Buffalo that the team has reached the playoffs. 
1257	The Bills have been regarded by sports books and pundits as Super Bowl favorites.
1258	“It’s humbling,” McDermott said. 
1259	“It really is. That’s how I feel about it. I’m humbled to be a part of it in this great town that doesn’t get as much credit as it deserves.”A 25-yard field goal by Buffalo’s Tyler Bass ended a back-and forth affair between two of the league’s best offenses. 
1260	The Bills marched 86 yards in the game’s closing six minutes to break a 29-29 tie. 
1261	With 50 seconds remaining in the game, Miami defensive back Kader Kohou was called for a pass interference penalty against Bills receiver Isaiah McKenzie, bringing the ball to the Dolphins’ 13-yard line. 
1262	That set the Bills up in prime field position for an easy kick to win the game.Bills quarterback Josh Allen completed 25 of 40 passes for 304 yards and four touchdowns, while Miami’s Tua Tagovailoa completed 17 of 30 passes for 234 yards and two scores. 
1263	Allen also added 77 rushing yards on 10 carries, helping to avenge the 21-19 loss the Bills suffered to the Dolphins in September.The game was played in temperatures as low as 27 degrees Fahrenheit. 
1264	Though snow flurries hit the area earlier in the day, a snowstorm projected to affect the game at halftime stood at bay until the middle of the fourth quarter. 
1265	By the final whistle, the field, which was once clear, was sodded with a sheet of fresh snow. 
1266	(The fans had, ahem, laid a little bit of the groundwork with their snowballs early in the game.)All week, the Dolphins tried to downplay the potential impact of the frigid conditions. 
1267	Miami Coach Mike McDaniel on Wednesday wore a T-shirt that read, “I Wish It Were Colder.” 
1268	The team practiced on the indoor fields at its training facility in Miami Gardens, Fla., with the air-conditioning turned up. 
1269	Linebacker Jaelan Phillips and cornerback Noah Igbinoghene participated in pregame warm-ups on Saturday shirtless with their bare chests exposed to the chill.McDaniel told reporters he did not believe the elements affected the Dolphins’ performance in the loss, their third straight.
1270	“I know a lot of people would like to make it about the weather, but our team never did,” McDaniel said. 
1271	“It was cool for you guys to talk about, but it was more about the football.”The Bills led at halftime, 21-13, after Allen fired a 4-yard touchdown pass to James Cook as time expired in the second quarter. 
1272	The Bills allowed only one touchdown to the Dolphins in the first half — an 11-yard run by Salvon Ahmed — despite Miami entering the red zone three times. 
1273	Allen threw three touchdowns before halftime as the Dolphins’ defense struggled to contain him and his receivers while he scrambled. 
1274	Allen also was not sacked in the first half.Then the Bills got sloppy. 
1275	Buffalo converted none of its four third-down attempts in the third quarter, sputtering after an explosive first half. 
1276	But the Dolphins, who entered Saturday with the league’s ninth-best scoring offense, scored two touchdowns in the period: Tagovailoa connected with Jaylen Waddle for a 67-yard touchdown and with the speedy Tyreek Hill for a 20-yard score. 
1277	The Bills finished the quarter down, 26-21.“You’re going to have ups and downs in every game,” Bills tight end Dawson Knox said. 
1278	“There’s going to be those lulls. The best teams find ways to push through that. They find ways to win, whether it’s by 1 or 100.”Miami stretched its lead in the fourth after Phillips strip-sacked Allen and the Dolphins recovered the ball. 
1279	Five plays later, their lead widened to 29-21 with 11:56 remaining in the game after a 47-yard field goal. 
1280	Allen was sacked twice in the second half as offensive line protection wore down and Miami’s pass rush began penetrating the backfield more often.But the Bills clawed back. 
1281	Allen threw a five-yard touchdown pass to Knox with about nine minutes remaining the fourth quarter. 
1282	Allen then dove over the end zone for the two-point conversion, which officials ruled as successful after a lengthy review, tying the game at 29. 
1283	The Dolphins spent the next three minutes trying to score, but ended up punting, paving the way for Buffalo’s game-winning drive.Since the off-season, after the Bills added linebacker Von Miller to an already-stout roster, Super Bowl expectations have grown immensely for the Bills. 
1284	They started 6-1 before losing back-to-back games to the Jets and Minnesota Vikings. 
1285	Both of those contests were decided by three points, and ended in Bills losses partly because of sloppy play and turnovers in the second half.The Bills have since won five straight games, becoming one of the most complete teams in the league. 
1286	Entering Saturday, the offense ranked second in yards, and the defense ranked second in points allowed even after Miller injured his knee against the Detroit Lions on Thanksgiving. 
1287	But despite their lofty aspirations, Allen said he does not want to think too far ahead.
1288	“Can’t win the Super Bowl unless you make the playoffs,” Allen said. 
1289	“That’s goal No. 1 down. Goal No. 2 is to clinch the division. That’s how we’ll take it, one game at a time.”
1290	When Chris Licht told his boss, Stephen Colbert, the host of the CBS program “Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” in February that he had been offered the chief executive job at CNN, Mr. Colbert was blunt: “Definitely don’t go do that.”But for Mr. Licht, nothing less than democracy itself was at stake. 
1291	He argued he could make CNN a news channel that people trusted, as opposed to one that monetized partisan combat.
1292	“Oh, man, you used to be in news, remember?” 
1293	Mr. Colbert recalled telling him. 
1294	“You said this was so much nicer — 12 weeks off, good pay, laugh for an hour every night. Everyone is really nice; you can say anything you want, and nobody leaks it. It’s great.”“CNN would be lucky to get you,” Mr. Colbert continued. 
1295	“But you’re my friend, and I’m telling you not to go.”“This is a calling,” Mr. Licht countered.At which point Mr. Colbert stopped trying to dissuade him: “I can’t negotiate with a calling.”On Feb. 28, Mr. Licht was named CNN’s new chief executive. 
1296	Since then, he and Mr. Colbert have spoken nearly every Friday. 
1297	Each time, Mr. Colbert begins with the same four words:“I told you so.”By almost any measure, Mr. Licht, 51, has had a rough start. 
1298	His first major act was to kill the network’s fledgling streaming service, CNN+, and fire 400 or so people working on it. 
1299	CNN’s revenue and profits have plunged to a projected $750 million this year, down from $1.25 billion last year, partly from the costs associated with CNN+, the network acknowledged. 
1300	CNN’s ratings declined, on average, this year compared with 2021, according to Nielsen, with CNN falling behind MSNBC for the first time in prime time on election night among total viewers. 
1301	(CNN prevailed in the coveted 25-to-54 age group.)At the end of November, Mr. Licht levied another round of job cuts — this time just under 10 percent of CNN’s work force of about 4,000, which plunged morale further. 
1302	Among the casualties were familiar commentators like Chris Cillizza, key behind-the-scenes producers with decades of experience, and the entirety of HLN, CNN’s sister network, and its popular morning host, Robin Meade.A chorus of media pundits has pounced on every tidbit of bad news. 
1303	Mr. Licht’s early programming efforts aimed at repositioning the network as broader and less partisan have prompted howls of criticism, with former MSNBC host and former colleague Keith Olbermann publicly calling Mr. Licht a “TV Fascist” after he moved Don Lemon, a liberal host, from a prime-time slot to a revamped morning show.
1304	“The uninformed vitriol, especially from the left, has been stunning,” Mr. Licht said in one of several interviews with The New York Times spanning his nearly eight-month tenure. 
1305	“Which proves my point: so much of what passes for news is name-calling, half-truths and desperation.”Mr. 
1306	Licht said he was under no illusion that stepping into the chief executive job would be easy or make him popular. 
1307	The network’s previous parent, the telecommunications giant AT&T, had just spun off its Warner Media subsidiary, which included CNN, into a new company run by Discovery’s chief executive, David Zaslav.Just two months before the companies merged and only weeks before CNN+ was introduced to the world, the network’s popular and longtime chief executive, Jeff Zucker, was forced to resign after failing to disclose a romantic relationship with his top lieutenant, Allison Gollust. 
1308	Some at CNN felt Mr. Zucker had been unfairly sacrificed and remained staunchly loyal to their former boss.CNN had also become the poster child for the poisoned relationship between former President Donald J. Trump and mainstream media organizations. 
1309	Mr. Trump repeatedly branded CNN as “fake news,” and his administration engaged in open warfare with CNN correspondents like Jim Acosta, whom Mr. Trump once called “a rude, terrible person” during a news conference. 
1310	In 2018, CNN’s New York headquarters had to be evacuated after a bomb threat.CNN remained enviably profitable, earning over $1 billion a year for the past five years. 
1311	But cable news, along with all cable channels, has been in secular decline, troubled by shifting viewer habits in an era of cord cutting and an exodus to streaming services and online news sites.It’s not clear anyone could surmount those challenges, let alone someone who’d just spent nearly six years at a late-night entertainment show and had never managed a complex, globe-spanning organization with thousands of employees.So why even take the job?
1312	Mr. 
1313	Licht seemed to have TV news in his DNA. 
1314	As a child, he’d created a fictional TV news network, WBC, and produced his own newscast using a VCR camera in his basement in Newtown, Conn. 
1315	At about the age of 9, he met the NBC legal correspondent Carl Stern on a family vacation and, in Mr. Licht’s telling, “stuck to him like glue.” 
1316	Mr. Licht pried the newsman’s phone number from him and used it regularly. 
1317	“I was obsessed,” Mr. Licht said. 
1318	After college at Syracuse University, Mr. Licht landed jobs at NBC affiliates in Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
1319	As a reporter and producer, he covered a mass shooting in San Bernardino, the plane crash that killed John F. Kennedy Jr., two presidential campaigns and three Olympics.In 2005, he moved to NBC’s sibling network, MSNBC, soon becoming an executive producer for “Morning Joe,” which he helped develop into an improbable success in its hotly competitive morning time slot. 
1320	Notably, the two hosts, the former Republican politician Joe Scarborough and the more liberal former CBS correspondent Mika Brzezinski, straddled the political divide. 
1321	The tension between them seemed to enhance their audience appeal. 
1322	Mr. Licht encouraged them to be themselves and embrace the unexpected. 
1323	(They later married.)Mr. 
1324	Licht moved to CBS in 2010, where he’d scored another early morning success. 
1325	He lifted ratings at the perennial also-ran “CBS This Morning” on the strength of the program’s three hosts, Charlie Rose, Gayle King and Norah O’Donnell, and an emphasis on news and in-depth interviews, rather than the lighter fare format of its competitors “Today” and “Good Morning America.”After having a brain aneurysm in 2010 when he was still under 40, Mr. Licht wrote a book about what he learned from the experience, while still describing himself as a “killer TV producer” with “no urge to surrender my spot in the fast lane,” even after the near-fatal incident.Restless after six years at “This Morning,” in 2016 he joined the then-faltering CBS program “Late Show With Stephen Colbert.” 
1326	Within a year, Mr. Colbert had seized the late-night ratings crown from Jimmy Fallon of NBC’s “Tonight Show.”Soon after the Warner-Discovery deal was announced, Mr. Zaslav summoned Mr. Licht to Discovery’s headquarters in Manhattan on 19th Street and asked what he thought of CNN.Mr. 
1327	Licht told him he had no interest in running it. 
1328	“I got out of news, and I’m not going back,” Mr. Licht had insisted.Mr. 
1329	Zaslav ignored the demurral. 
1330	Over the next several weeks, he kept making the case to Mr. Licht. 
1331	In fact, Mr. Zaslav said in an interview that he never considered anyone else for the job.The two men have known each other for 15 years, since both were working at NBC, where Mr. Zaslav helped start MSNBC. 
1332	In the years since, they have had breakfast once a quarter. 
1333	Mr. Licht has looked to Mr. Zaslav as a mentor, and Mr. Zaslav has admired Mr. Licht’s work ethic and drive.
1334	“He’s a fighter, and he likes to win,” Mr. Zaslav said.At their first meeting, Mr. Zaslav argued that running CNN would be “a great opportunity to build the No. 1 news brand in the world,” and “the most trusted brand in news where people go every day and in a crisis for the best version of the truth.”And more than that: “This is important for America. It’s important for a functioning society.”Mr. 
1335	Licht and Mr. Zaslav — not to mention Warner’s largest shareholder, the media mogul John Malone — were philosophically aligned. 
1336	Fox and MSNBC were “advocacy” networks, as Mr. Zaslav put it, a proven business model appealing to like-minded viewers but of scant, if any, value as a public service. 
1337	Whether by design or happenstance, he believed CNN had tacked left, a pale version of MSNBC that nonetheless alienated wide parts of the American electorate with a focus on politics and the president at the time, Mr. Trump.Ted Turner’s mantra had always been “the news is the star.” 
1338	Mr. Trump “is not the star,” Mr. Zaslav said.Yet Mr. Licht was noncommittal. 
1339	On a subsequent phone call, Mr. Zaslav urged Mr. Licht to think about CNN and whether he’d be interested in the top job. 
1340	After Mr. Licht hung up, his wife, Jennifer Blanco Licht, a former TV executive herself, asked: “Is this crazy? I think you should do it.”The two men continued the conversation on a long walk in Central Park. 
1341	(They both live near the park.) 
1342	During that conversation, Mr. Zaslav warned Mr. Licht that he’d be closely scrutinized and judged harshly. 
1343	Is your family ready for this? 
1344	Are you ready for this? 
1345	Because “it will be brutal,” Mr. Zaslav said.Mr. 
1346	Licht said he doesn’t recall Mr. Zaslav ever offering him the job, or his accepting it. 
1347	At one point, Mr. Zaslav simply asked, “Who’s your lawyer?” and started acting like Mr. Licht was CNN’s future chief executive. 
1348	A contract ensued.On their first lunch afterward, at Mr. Zaslav’s usual corner table at Gramercy Tavern, Mr. Zaslav indicated their yearslong relationship had fundamentally changed. 
1349	“We’ve been friends for 15 years,” Mr. Zaslav said. 
1350	“We’re not friends any more. You work for me.”Almost immediately, their shared vision of saving democracy ran into the harsh reality of cable news economics.With Fox News and MSNBC having already staked out the right and left ends of the political spectrum, attracting the middle (what Mr. Licht referred to as “normal” people) has proved elusive. 
1351	Mr. Zaslav had stressed that he didn’t care — at least not much — about CNN’s current ratings, revenue or profitability. 
1352	He recognized that it would take years to reposition and rebuild the network. 
1353	But even he had his limits.AT&T’s board had approved an ambitious budget of $350 million for CNN+, much of it already spent by the time Mr. Licht arrived. 
1354	Many more millions would be needed. 
1355	With Warner facing pressure from Wall Street to find $3 billion in savings, on April 21, Mr. Licht killed the streaming service after less than a month on air.In an effort to restore morale and calm anxiety, Mr. Licht assured CNN employees at a network-wide town hall meeting on May 5 that Warner Bros. 
1356	Discovery didn’t anticipate further job cuts at CNN because there was no overlap between the news network and Discovery’s cable channels, and thus there wasn’t anyone else doing the same jobs that would need to be cut. 
1357	In a series of additional town hall meetings, most of them leaked almost immediately to The New York Times and other news outlets, Mr. Licht also laid the groundwork for the network’s shift to broader, less political and less partisan coverage. 
1358	This was not, he stressed repeatedly, a move to the “center,” a boring, political neutral zone that Mr. Licht wasn’t even sure existed. 
1359	Rather, it was an attempt to explore controversial issues from varied perspectives — not to tell people “what to think,” as he put it, but “how to think,” or what he called a “blueprint for how to make decisions.”In July, Mr. Licht made a highly symbolic pilgrimage to Capitol Hill noteworthy for its inclusion of Republicans like the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, and Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas. 
1360	Although he spent equal time with Democratic leaders like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Mr. Licht was irritated that his visit was billed as an “apology tour” and effort to coax Republicans back onto the network — part of CNN’s perceived move to the right.After long absences, several Republicans have since appeared on CNN, including Mr. McCarthy and Senator Rick Scott of Florida.Featuring hosts and guests with opposing points of view and playing up controversy has paid ratings dividends on cable in the past, notably on CNN’s own “Crossfire,” which came under criticism for evolving into to a verbal food fight criticized by the comedian Jon Stewart as “hurting America.”But Mr. Licht said he wasn’t interested in controversy for its own sake, but to offer a “rational conversation about polarizing issues.” 
1361	After watching CNN, he hopes people will “take what they’ve heard to the dinner table and have a discussion,” he said. 
1362	“That’s a dream of mine.”Two examples have been coverage of the abortion debate in the wake of the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade, and the debate over gun rights. 
1363	To vocal criticism from the left, he hired Stephen Gutowski, founder and editor of The Reload, a firearms website. 
1364	No one wants a school shooting, said Mr. Licht, whose hometown, Newtown, was the site of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre. 
1365	“But we have to understand the culture of people who like guns,” he said.
1366	“This is not vanilla, centrist or boring,” he added.Mr. 
1367	Licht has barely begun to put his stamp on the network’s programming, but it’s already evident in the new morning show, “CNN This Morning.” 
1368	Mr. Licht picked the hosts, persuading the left-leaning Don Lemon to trade his prime-time slot for early morning, and pairing him with the former Daily Caller reporter and CNN White House correspondent Kaitlan Collins and Poppy Harlow, a former host of “CNN Newsroom.” 
1369	The show takes a somewhat similar approach to the one he used at “CBS This Morning” (which also shares a near-identical name).
1370	In a series of interviews with The Times, Mr. Licht visibly came to life talking about “This Morning” and its co-hosts. 
1371	“They obviously like each other,” he said. 
1372	“The chemistry is great. I love the collaboration. Every day, it evolves. It’s not like me giving orders. It’s so much fun.”“This Morning” debuted on Nov. 1. 
1373	The New York Post (which shares ownership with CNN’s rival, Fox News) reported the next day that “‘CNN This Morning’ bombs in debut,” drawing just 387,000 viewers, far behind rival morning shows and trailing its predecessor on CNN, “New Day.” 
1374	CNN called the instant critique “absurd and cheap” after just one day’s data. 
1375	(Since then, the show has gained slightly among total viewers.) 
1376	More significantly, Mr. Licht noted, “This Morning” has broken news, including the chief Washington correspondent Jake Tapper’s scoop that Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona was leaving the Democratic Party to become an Independent.Prime time looms as an even greater challenge. 
1377	In August, Mr. Licht moved Mr. Tapper from his 4 p.m. anchor position to the coveted 9 p.m. slot that had been vacated by Chris Cuomo after CNN fired him for what it deemed inappropriate efforts to help his brother, New York’s former governor, Andrew Cuomo, fend off the sexual harassment allegations that led to his resignation from office. 
1378	The experiment with Mr. Tapper fared poorly in the ratings and lasted just one month.Mr. 
1379	Licht acknowledged that prime time remains an “open canvas.” 
1380	He said he and his colleagues were meeting and “throwing things against the wall, looking at off-the-beaten path opportunities.” 
1381	Among the names tossed out have been entertainment, comedy and sports figures. 
1382	He declined to be more specific but promised surprises.Miklos Sarvary, a professor and director of the media and technology program at Columbia Business School, said that entertainment was potentially more profitable than low-margin news. 
1383	“But what does that do to the brand if you want to be the most trusted name in news?” he said. 
1384	“News is supposed to be serious. I’m not sure that putting on a comedian is a great move for credibility.”Mr. 
1385	Licht said he understood Mr. Sarvary’s point, but said prime time offered “some leeway for being a little different.”“It has to be compelling and entertaining without hurting the news brand,” he said, citing his former boss Mr. Colbert, and Mr. Stewart as “the kind of people who’d work,” while acknowledging that Mr. Stewart is already locked into a lucrative contract at Apple TV.Every Saturday, Mr. Licht sends Mr. Zaslav a memo with highlights of the week and programming and financial updates. 
1386	Mr. Licht’s growth strategy is focused on CNN.com, which attracts more than 200 million unique visitors each month, according to CNN. 
1387	But at its peak, CNN digital generated only about 10 percent of the network’s profits, Mr. Licht confirmed.On Oct. 13, Mr. Licht made his debut in front of Warner Brother Discovery’s board at a hotel in Los Angeles, where he outlined both his growth and content strategy. 
1388	Asked about his efforts to make CNN less partisan, Mr. Licht gave this analogy: Suppose it’s raining outside. 
1389	CNN plans to have people on who love the rain, and it will have people on who say they don’t like the rain. 
1390	But it won’t have anyone on who says it’s sunny out.Mr. 
1391	Licht said he used the analogy to make clear that a less-partisan CNN did not mean it was any less committed to truth. 
1392	“This wasn’t to plot a new course but to assure people we would not let up one inch in being truth tellers,” he said. 
1393	“The change is we will not do Trump 24/7 or let him dictate our agenda.”By all accounts, Mr. Licht’s presentation was warmly received by directors, including Mr. Malone.Mr. 
1394	Licht’s vision is contending with industrywide pressures to cut costs. 
1395	(He said he appreciates but doesn’t really believe Mr. Zaslav’s professed indifference to financial results.) 
1396	By announcing the need for more layoffs on Oct. 26, he said he hoped to engage in a “transparent” process that would leave everyone feeling they’d been heard. 
1397	But, he said, “it would be irresponsible not to do the tough work now.” 
1398	He added, “I promise you CNN will be more profitable next year.”However transparent, many in CNN’s rank and file felt blindsided by the cuts, especially after what they perceived as his earlier reassurances that no further layoffs would be needed. 
1399	In a all-staff meeting in November, Mr. Licht said he stood by his earlier remark that there would be no merger-related layoffs, and “I absolutely would not have said something that I did not believe to be true.” 
1400	But he said he understood how his remarks had hurt his credibility. 
1401	“I have to win that credibility back,” he acknowledged.Mr. 
1402	Licht said the firings were the “low point” of his tenure so far.At another all-staff meeting this month, aimed at restoring morale, Mr. Licht took questions and then ended with a passage he wrote himself:In terms of morale, let me just say, you work at a world-renowned news organization alongside the best journalists on the globe. 
1403	Your jobs have meaning. 
1404	Your jobs have an impact. 
1405	You are part of something bigger, of something with tremendous meaning. 
1406	And nothing about that has changed. 
1407	And you have in me as a leader, who has done a lot of your jobs, someone who has your back every step of the way. 
1408	My loyalty is first and foremost to this organization and to journalism without fear or favor to anyone else, including our parent company.That’s why I’m here. 
1409	That’s why I took this job.
1410	“I want CNN to be essential to society,” Mr. Licht said in one of our interviews. 
1411	“If you’re essential then the revenue will follow.”And if it doesn’t?
1412	“Maybe it won’t work,” Mr. Licht conceded. 
1413	“But I’d rather try to win this way.”Benjamin Mullin and Michael M. Grynbaum contributed reporting.
1414	By Eric Lipton, Michael Crowley and John IsmayWASHINGTON — The prospect of growing military threats from both China and Russia is driving bipartisan support for a surge in Pentagon spending, setting up another potential boom for weapons makers that is likely to extend beyond the war in Ukraine.Congress is on track in the coming week to give final approval to a national military budget for the current fiscal year that is expected to reach approximately $858 billion — or $45 billion above what President Biden had requested.If approved at this level, the Pentagon budget will have grown at 4.3 percent per year over the last two years — even after inflation — compared with an average of less than 1 percent a year in real dollars between 2015 and 2021, according to an analysis by Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments for The New York Times.Spending on procurement would rise sharply next year, including a 55 percent jump in Army funding to buy new missiles and a 47 percent jump for the Navy’s weapons purchases.On Friday, Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden’s national security adviser, put the buildup in strategic terms, saying the war in Ukraine had exposed shortfalls in the nation’s military industrial base that needed to be addressed to ensure the United States is “able to support Ukraine and to be able to deal with contingencies elsewhere in the world.”Lockheed Martin, the nation’s largest military contractor, had booked more than $950 million worth of its own missile military orders from the Pentagon in part to refill stockpiles being used in Ukraine. 
1415	The Army has awarded Raytheon Technologies more than $2 billion in contracts to deliver missile systems to expand or replenish weapons used to help Ukraine.
1416	“We went through six years of Stingers in 10 months,” Gregory J. Hayes, Raytheon’s chief executive, said in an interview earlier this month, referring to 1,600 of the company’s shoulder-fired antiaircraft missiles sent by the U.S. government to Ukraine. 
1417	“So it will take us multiple years to restock and replenish.”But those contracts are just the leading edge of what is shaping up to be a big new defense buildup. 
1418	Military spending next year is on track to reach its highest level in inflation-adjusted terms since the peaks in the costs of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars between 2008 and 2011, and the second highest in inflation-adjusted terms since World War II — a level that is more than the budgets for the next 10 largest cabinet agencies combined.Even more orders are coming in to military contractors from U.S. allies in Europe and Asia, as they too have concluded they must do more to arm themselves against rising global threats. 
1419	Japan moved this month to double its spending on defense over the next five years, putting aside a pacifist stand it has largely maintained since 1945.And none of this counts an estimated $18 billion of planned but now delayed weapons deliveries by the United States to arm Taiwan against a possible future attack by China.The combination of the Ukraine war and the growing consensus about the emergence of a new era of superpower confrontation is prompting efforts to ensure the military industrial base can respond to surges in demand. 
1420	The issue has become urgent in some cases as the U.S. and its NATO allies seek to keep weapons flowing to Ukraine without diminishing their own stocks to worrisome levels.The Ukrainian military has run through years’ worth of the missile production capacity of Western suppliers in a matter of months. 
1421	At the same time, contractors remain concerned about investing to meet growing demand for weapons that could dry up again when the war ends or politics shifts course.
1422	“The difficulty of starting a production line back up, that doesn’t come for free,” Tom Arseneault, president of BAE Systems, which is now considering restarting its M777 howitzer manufacturing line, which the company had been in the process of shutting down. 
1423	The M777 is a highly accurate, towed gun that fires 155-millimeter artillery shells, which are also in diminishing supply.The annual military authorization bill that passed the Senate on Thursday prevents the Air Force and Navy from retiring aging weapons systems that the military would like to take out of service, including certain C-130 transport planes or F-22 fighter jets. 
1424	At the same time, it includes billions of dollars in extra money to build even more new ships and planes than the Pentagon itself asked for, including $2.2 billion alone for an extra Navy-guided missile destroyer, according to the Senate Armed Services Committee.And there is $678 million to expand ammunition plants in spots such as Scranton, Pa.
1425	; Middletown, Iowa; and Kingsport, Tenn., where contractors work with the Army to manufacture the ammunition that Ukrainian artillery crews have burned through at an alarming rate. 
1426	(The money for these programs is expected to be included in a huge appropriations bill that appears to be on track to pass Congress and signed into law by Mr. Biden by the end of the week.)Spending could be even higher, as Congress is also considering a request for an extra $21.7 billion for the Pentagon, above the already expanded 2023 annual budget, to allocate more money to resupply materials used in Ukraine.In an indication of how government policy is shifting to rebuild industrial capacity for the military, Congress this year has moved to allow the Defense Department to more broadly make multiyear spending commitments for certain weapons systems and shipbuilding operations. 
1427	That is a provision that industry lobbyists have long pushed for, arguing it gives companies certainty that investments they make to start production will see continued returns in future years.
1428	“We have to make a commitment with the industry,” said Senator Deb Fischer, Republican of Nebraska and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who supported the change. 
1429	“Then the industry will step forward to restart or grow their production lines.”That move alone suggests $73 billion in additional munitions orders could be on the way in the next three years, contracts that will largely benefit the big players like Lockheed and Raytheon, according to an analysis by Myles Walton, a military industry analyst at Wolfe Research, a Wall Street research firm.These trends help explain stock market performance of the major military contractors — a small group of which control the bulk of sales to the Pentagon. 
1430	Lockheed and Northrop Grumman both have seen their stock prices jump more than 35 percent so far this year in a market whose main indexes are down overall for the year.Opponents of higher military budgets say they are frustrated.Military contractors are “riding high again, and Ukraine just gives them another argument as to why things need to continue onward and upward,” said William D. Hartung, a fellow at the non-interventionist Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft.
1431	“The trillion-dollar defense budget — that is where we are headed,” said Lawrence J. Korb, who served as an assistant defense secretary during the Reagan administration and was once a vice president at Raytheon. 
1432	“Nobody seems to want to make the tough choices. Even the Democrats now seem to be afraid to be seen as being soft on defense.”The biggest barrier for growth for major military contractors — the list includes Lockheed, Raytheon, Boeing, General Dynamics, BAE, Northrop Grumman and Huntington Ingalls Industries — is finding sufficient supplies of key components, such as microelectronics and missile warheads, as well as a steady supply of new employees to assemble all these items.
1433	“You cannot throw much more money at the seven shipbuilders that build U.S. warships in the United States of America right now,” Adm. Michael M. Gilday, the chief of naval operations, said this month during the Reagan National Defense Forum in California, referring to a $32.6 billion shipbuilding budget in the military authorization bill that is $4.7 billion more than the Pentagon requested. 
1434	“Their capacity is about at max. And Congress is helping us max them out.”Raytheon, which has 180,000 workers, has hired 27,000 new employees so far this year, its chief executive said in October. 
1435	But even with that, it is still running into bottlenecks in terms of available parts and labor shortages that are slowing sales, its executives said.The sheer scale of the munitions and missiles sent to Ukraine illustrates just how much matériel a war can consume.That includes more than 104 million rounds of small-arms ammunition, at least one million rounds of 155-millimeter artillery shells, 46,000 anti-tank weapons, more than 1,600 Stinger antiaircraft missiles and 8,500 Javelin anti-armor missiles, according to a Pentagon tally.The resupply challenge is not just a matter of money. 
1436	Military contractors have nearly stopped manufacturing Stingers — Raytheon’s last contract from the U.S. government was in 2002, Mr. Haynes said. 
1437	And while Javelins are still being made jointly by Raytheon and Lockheed — in September they were awarded a $311 million contract to deliver more of them — historically they have been able to make only about 2,100 a year, or about a quarter of what Ukraine has burned through since the outbreak of the war in February.In total, the Pentagon as of early December had awarded at least $6 billion to military contractors to resupply these and other items sent to Ukraine.
1438	“We’re going to ramp up,” Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said this month. 
1439	“We’ve really been working closely with industry to both increase their capacity and also the speed at which they’re able to produce.”The overall spending on national defense still remains relatively low as a percentage of the nation’s economy: about 3.2 percent of the gross domestic product this year, compared to 37 percent during World War II and 13 percent during the Korean War, according to Pentagon records.Still, companies are scrambling to avoid or resolve bottlenecks caused by the increase in demand.Lockheed, for example, spent more than $60 million of its own money in advance of getting Pentagon contract commitment to build more of its High Mobility Artillery Rocket System vehicles, or HIMARS, which fire guided rockets carrying 200 pounds of explosives that can hit targets nearly 50 miles away. 
1440	The vehicles have been much sought after by Ukraine, which has used them to devastating effect against the Russians.Traditionally, Lockheed has been able to build 60 of these trucks per year, but it is now shifting production to 24 hours a day and seven days a week in an effort to bring that annual total to 96 units. 
1441	It also now has a new $430 million contract to deliver more HIMARS, along with a new $521 million contract to build more of the rockets, called GMLRS, that these vehicles can fire.These resupply orders, while large in terms of many other contracts the federal government issues, are still relatively small for the biggest contractors. 
1442	At Lockheed, for example, about 70 percent of sales come from the U.S. government, and most of the rest from other governments worldwide. 
1443	Supply chain and labor shortage problems are cutting into sales and profits, including at Lockheed, which expects to see annual sales decline this year to $62.3 billion from $67 billion.
1444	“The clutch is engaging but into some lower gears initially,” James Taiclet, Lockheed’s chief executive, said in October, adding that higher sales might not show up for another year.But there are more of the big-ticket orders coming. 
1445	In the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Switzerland and Germany have both moved in recent months to finalize orders for the F-35 fighter jets, collectively worth $16 billion. 
1446	Overall foreign military sales notifications to Congress so far in 2022 have totaled $81 billion, the third highest figure in the last 25 years, with an increasing share of these sales going to European and Asian nations.Next year’s military budget also includes major investments in new hypersonic weapons that are also being aggressively pursued by China. 
1447	Raytheon and Northrop Grumman in September won a $1 billion contract just to build prototypes for the Air Force.Other companies want to replace older equipment sent to Ukraine with newer models. 
1448	BAE, for example, intends to sell the Army more armored vehicles called AMPVs, in place of the more than 200 of BAE’s Vietnam-era M113 armored personnel carriers sent to Ukraine, which it no longer makes.
1449	“Nothing’s cheap, right?” said Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro  this month at the conference in California, as he ran through many new investments the Navy is making. 
1450	“Nothing’s free.”Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.
1451	After three pandemic-battered years at the box office, Hollywood desperately wanted “Avatar: The Way of Water,” the sequel to the top-grossing film on record, to arrive like a ticket-selling tsunami. 
1452	Surveys that track audience interest suggested that “The Way of Water” could arrive to as much as $175 million in opening-weekend ticket sales in the United States and Canada.It was not to be.The ultraexpensive event movie collected about $134 million at North American theaters over its first three days, according to Comscore, which compiles ticketing data. 
1453	Directed by James Cameron and revisiting the fantasy world of Pandora, “The Way of Water” cost Disney an estimated $600 million to make and market. 
1454	Three more sequels are planned.But there may still be a way for “The Way of Water” to become a big, blue juggernaut — possibly even surpassing the $2 billion in global sales that Cameron publicly set as the benchmark for financial success, given the film’s stratospheric production and marketing costs. 
1455	Consider what happened with the first “Avatar” in 2009. 
1456	It arrived to a soft $77 million and went on to gross $2.9 billion worldwide.
1457	“It’s not the kind of movie that you can analyze by looking at how the first weekend did,” said Richard L. Gelfond, the chief executive of IMAX Corporation. 
1458	“It’s all about how it holds on. I think the legs are going to be really strong.”IMAX is planning to play “The Way of Water” until the end of January, in part because there is very little competition until then. 
1459	Studios typically flood theaters with spectacles at this time of year because the holidays leave so many people with time on their hands. 
1460	But multiple event movies were pushed into 2023 because of pandemic-related slowdowns in production.AMC Entertainment, the world’s No. 1 multiplex operator, has more than 100,000 showtimes and 10 million seats on sale for “The Way of Water” through New Year’s Day in the United States alone.
1461	“The Way of Water” also arrived in cinemas in almost every international market over the weekend, collecting an additional $300.5 million, for a healthy global opening total of $434.5 million, according to Disney. 
1462	It was the second-highest global opening for the year, behind “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.”The top international market for “The Way of Water” was China, where the movie arrived to $57.1 million in ticket sales, despite restrictions on theater capacity in some major cities because of coronavirus outbreaks. 
1463	Also in China, IMAX delivered its biggest opening weekend marketing share ever, accounting for 27 percent of the box office in the country on only 1 percent of total screens.In North America, an unusually large percentage of ticket sales for “The Way of Water” came from IMAX theaters and other premium-format locations, including those with 3-D presentation. 
1464	Those venues accounted for 62 percent of the film’s domestic total, according to Disney. 
1465	Some people may have had a difficult time finding tickets to such screenings — sellouts were common — and decided to wait, box office analysts said.
1466	“The Way of Water,” an ecological parable that is a hybrid of live-action footage and specialized animation, has a marathon run time of three hours and 12 minutes, which may have been too much of a commitment for some people on the weekend before Christmas. 
1467	But most box office analysts do not see length as a problem for “The Way of Water” in the long run, in part because reviews have been quite positive. 
1468	Ticket buyers gave the movie an A grade in CinemaScore exit polls.
1469	(The first “Avatar” was two hours and 42 minutes long. “The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,” with a run time of three hours and 29 minutes, holds the length record for a no-intermission, wide-release film, according to Comscore.)“Expectations aside, this is an outstanding opening,” said David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter on box office numbers, noting that “The Way of Water” arrived to stronger ticket sales than most superhero sequels. 
1470	“The movie is set up for a very strong run,” he added.
1471	ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. — The referee warned the Buffalo Bills fans inside Highmark Stadium as if he were a teacher scolding schoolchildren at recess.If their flying snowballs hit a Miami Dolphins player during live action, the referee said, the Bills would be penalized 15 yards. 
1472	Security guards in neon yellow jackets had already migrated toward the Miami bench to dissuade fans from pelting the players and coaches there. 
1473	The large video monitor over the end zone also repeated the message.
1474	“That was great,” Bills safety Jordan Poyer said in a postgame news conference Saturday. 
1475	“That was the first time I had ever heard that.”The intensity of the Bills fans highlighted the increased stakes of the contest, as the divisional rivals jockeyed for playoff seeding in the loaded A.F.C. The Bills won the game, 32-29, clinching a playoff berth and edging closer toward home-field advantage throughout the postseason. 
1476	It is the fifth time in Coach Sean McDermott’s six seasons at Buffalo that the team has reached the playoffs. 
1477	The Bills have been regarded by sports books and pundits as Super Bowl favorites.
1478	“It’s humbling,” McDermott said. 
1479	“It really is. That’s how I feel about it. I’m humbled to be a part of it in this great town that doesn’t get as much credit as it deserves.”A 25-yard field goal by Buffalo’s Tyler Bass ended a back-and forth affair between two of the league’s best offenses. 
1480	The Bills marched 86 yards in the game’s closing six minutes to break a 29-29 tie. 
1481	With 50 seconds remaining in the game, Miami defensive back Kader Kohou was called for a pass interference penalty against Bills receiver Isaiah McKenzie, bringing the ball to the Dolphins’ 13-yard line. 
1482	That set the Bills up in prime field position for an easy kick to win the game.Bills quarterback Josh Allen completed 25 of 40 passes for 304 yards and four touchdowns, while Miami’s Tua Tagovailoa completed 17 of 30 passes for 234 yards and two scores. 
1483	Allen also added 77 rushing yards on 10 carries, helping to avenge the 21-19 loss the Bills suffered to the Dolphins in September.The game was played in temperatures as low as 27 degrees Fahrenheit. 
1484	Though snow flurries hit the area earlier in the day, a snowstorm projected to affect the game at halftime stood at bay until the middle of the fourth quarter. 
1485	By the final whistle, the field, which was once clear, was sodded with a sheet of fresh snow. 
1486	(The fans had, ahem, laid a little bit of the groundwork with their snowballs early in the game.)All week, the Dolphins tried to downplay the potential impact of the frigid conditions. 
1487	Miami Coach Mike McDaniel on Wednesday wore a T-shirt that read, “I Wish It Were Colder.” 
1488	The team practiced on the indoor fields at its training facility in Miami Gardens, Fla., with the air-conditioning turned up. 
1489	Linebacker Jaelan Phillips and cornerback Noah Igbinoghene participated in pregame warm-ups on Saturday shirtless with their bare chests exposed to the chill.McDaniel told reporters he did not believe the elements affected the Dolphins’ performance in the loss, their third straight.
1490	“I know a lot of people would like to make it about the weather, but our team never did,” McDaniel said. 
1491	“It was cool for you guys to talk about, but it was more about the football.”The Bills led at halftime, 21-13, after Allen fired a 4-yard touchdown pass to James Cook as time expired in the second quarter. 
1492	The Bills allowed only one touchdown to the Dolphins in the first half — an 11-yard run by Salvon Ahmed — despite Miami entering the red zone three times. 
1493	Allen threw three touchdowns before halftime as the Dolphins’ defense struggled to contain him and his receivers while he scrambled. 
1494	Allen also was not sacked in the first half.Then the Bills got sloppy. 
1495	Buffalo converted none of its four third-down attempts in the third quarter, sputtering after an explosive first half. 
1496	But the Dolphins, who entered Saturday with the league’s ninth-best scoring offense, scored two touchdowns in the period: Tagovailoa connected with Jaylen Waddle for a 67-yard touchdown and with the speedy Tyreek Hill for a 20-yard score. 
1497	The Bills finished the quarter down, 26-21.“You’re going to have ups and downs in every game,” Bills tight end Dawson Knox said. 
1498	“There’s going to be those lulls. The best teams find ways to push through that. They find ways to win, whether it’s by 1 or 100.”Miami stretched its lead in the fourth after Phillips strip-sacked Allen and the Dolphins recovered the ball. 
1499	Five plays later, their lead widened to 29-21 with 11:56 remaining in the game after a 47-yard field goal. 
1500	Allen was sacked twice in the second half as offensive line protection wore down and Miami’s pass rush began penetrating the backfield more often.But the Bills clawed back. 
1501	Allen threw a five-yard touchdown pass to Knox with about nine minutes remaining the fourth quarter. 
1502	Allen then dove over the end zone for the two-point conversion, which officials ruled as successful after a lengthy review, tying the game at 29. 
1503	The Dolphins spent the next three minutes trying to score, but ended up punting, paving the way for Buffalo’s game-winning drive.Since the off-season, after the Bills added linebacker Von Miller to an already-stout roster, Super Bowl expectations have grown immensely for the Bills. 
1504	They started 6-1 before losing back-to-back games to the Jets and Minnesota Vikings. 
1505	Both of those contests were decided by three points, and ended in Bills losses partly because of sloppy play and turnovers in the second half.The Bills have since won five straight games, becoming one of the most complete teams in the league. 
1506	Entering Saturday, the offense ranked second in yards, and the defense ranked second in points allowed even after Miller injured his knee against the Detroit Lions on Thanksgiving. 
1507	But despite their lofty aspirations, Allen said he does not want to think too far ahead.
1508	“Can’t win the Super Bowl unless you make the playoffs,” Allen said. 
1509	“That’s goal No. 1 down. Goal No. 2 is to clinch the division. That’s how we’ll take it, one game at a time.”

1520	In Ali’s recipe, you sauté bread crumbs with chopped pepperoni to create a salty, crunchy, fiery topping for seared chicken. 
1521	(I might use that stuff to top chicken thighs, then roast them crisp in a hot oven.)Kay’s tofu and bok choy with ginger-tahini sauce is simplicity itself, for which you steam soft tofu on a bed of bok choy, then drench everything with a creamy sauce amped up with ginger.

1542	The Russian soldier was named Dmitri Tsvigun. 
1543	A table tennis coach from a small city in Siberia, he had volunteered to fight in Ukraine. 
1544	But at age 30, he died from shrapnel wounds when a tank shell exploded near him in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk Province on Nov. 20.“He responded to a call from his heart to join the special military operation,” said a short memorial article in a local newspaper on Dec. 8. 
1545	That brief account got Mr. Tsvigun added to a list of confirmed Russian war deaths maintained by a small, dedicated team of data journalists and volunteers, as the Kremlin has largely avoided updating the number publicly.

1547	“If the Russian government does not count Russian casualties, then someone has to do it,” said David Frenkel, one of four data reporters from Mediazona running the project. 
1548	“It is important for us to explain to Russians the cost of the war,” he added. 
1549	“If they do not understand the cost from the pictures of devastated Ukrainian cities, then maybe the number of dead Russians will make them think about it.”The Russian government has tried to avoid just that by barely mentioning the death toll from the war it launched with the invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. 
1550	It has updated the number exactly twice: once at the end of March and again in September, when the defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, said that 5,937 Russian troops had been killed since the war started.That official number is notably smaller than estimates from Western military and intelligence officials. 
1551	Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for example, said in November that Moscow’s casualties were “well over 100,000 Russian soldiers killed and wounded.”There have been similar estimates for Ukrainian losses, with Mykhailo Podolyak, a senior adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky, telling a Ukrainian news station this month that up to 13,000 Ukrainian troops had died in the conflict.With so much fog of war shrouding the subject, Mediazona decided that online sleuthing was needed to establish a baseline of Russian deaths. 
1552	A scattered group of volunteers in Russia was already trying to document the deaths on their own, and the BBC News Russian service had done several articles on the subject, so they combined forces.They did not set out to document every death, and estimated that their Russian count was about one-third to half the true total. 
1553	But by harvesting as much information as was available from social media posts and putting a name to every death listed, they figured their number was better than an estimate.
1554	“It is not just about the number; it is about who died or how they died,” said Maxim Litavrin, another data journalist at Mediazona.Ukrainians upload a higgledy-piggledy stream of information about Russians killed in the war on several channels on the Telegram messaging application, including the names of the deceased. 
1555	The team of volunteer investigators in Russia then search social media posts for the names. 
1556	All the information from open sources ends up on a huge spreadsheet. 
1557	The journalists work quickly to check the links and to back up everything because personal posts often disappear. 
1558	They crosscheck names against a government website that lists people deceased throughout Russia but that does not specify military deaths.Seven out of 10 confirmations come from local news reports, the data journalists said, while the others are a mix. 
1559	They include announcements from local officials or employers; individual posts on VKontakte, the Russian equivalent of Facebook; and sources like pictures of memorial plaques put up in dead soldiers’ former schools.Every two weeks, Mediazona crunches all the numbers to break down the toll on its website, including deaths by region, military unit and age.The results can vary drastically by region. 
1560	In Dagestan, Russia, for example, where serving and dying in the Russian Army is considered an honor, officials tend to make statements about those killed.In some regions like Krasnodar, volunteers have counted hundreds of war dead by visiting cemeteries. 
1561	Even temporary tombstones in Russian cemeteries usually include a picture of the deceased, along with the name, military unit, date of birth and date of death.
1562	“Cemeteries give us a lot,” Mr. Frenkel said.Military analysts have mixed views on the project. 
1563	Some prefer to work with estimates of the overall number killed rather than a slice of the total. 
1564	Others stressed that the work had been especially helpful in identifying patterns.
1565	“The project is a useful snapshot of the breakdowns and wider patterns in Russian losses,” said Karolina Hird, a Russia analyst at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War. 
1566	“We know that Russian authorities are simply not presenting truthful reporting on losses.”One early pattern, for example, showed that about 20 percent of Russia’s war deaths were officers. 
1567	“That told us a lot about how the Russian Army operates,” said Olga Ivshina, a reporter with the BBC Russian service who alternates with Mediazona each week to tally the numbers. 
1568	It turned out that senior Russian officers were initially deployed near the front lines because junior officers could not issue orders.The information available online varies widely.A local community page posted pictures showing Alexander A. Dementov, 28, and Alexander Trokhov, 38, after they were drafted at the end of September. 
1569	They were both workers at the Nadezhdinski Metallurgical Plant in Serov, a Russian city in the Urals. 
1570	Then, a local newspaper reported on Dec. 7 that both men, who had served in the 55th motorized rifle brigade, died in a missile strike on Nov. 23.Sometimes, the details are sparse.Vsevolod Matveev was No. 10,000 on the spreadsheet. 
1571	The data journalists discovered that he was from the Sverdlovsk region in the Urals and that he was buried on Dec. 9 in the town of Zarechny. 
1572	From his picture, they could tell that he had served with a motorized infantry unit. 
1573	But that was it.When deaths cannot be confirmed by open sources, the names are put on a side list awaiting further details. 
1574	The Mediazona reporters noted that resistance to the wars in Afghanistan and Chechnya developed in tandem with the death toll, but there has been little sign of that in Russia.Spending every day scrolling through information about dead people is mentally taxing, they said, but certain posts stick with them. 
1575	Mr. Litavrin remembers reading about a 40-year-old man who had a quiet, regular life and a daughter, and volunteered in August. 
1576	He was killed after two weeks on the battlefield.
1577	“I wondered what he was thinking,” Mr. Litavrin said. 
1578	“It’s terrible.”
1579	By Eric Lipton, Michael Crowley and John IsmayWASHINGTON — The prospect of growing military threats from both China and Russia is driving bipartisan support for a surge in Pentagon spending, setting up another potential boom for weapons makers that is likely to extend beyond the war in Ukraine.Congress is on track in the coming week to give final approval to a national military budget for the current fiscal year that is expected to reach approximately $858 billion — or $45 billion above what President Biden had requested.If approved at this level, the Pentagon budget will have grown at 4.3 percent per year over the last two years — even after inflation — compared with an average of less than 1 percent a year in real dollars between 2015 and 2021, according to an analysis by Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments for The New York Times.Spending on procurement would rise sharply next year, including a 55 percent jump in Army funding to buy new missiles and a 47 percent jump for the Navy’s weapons purchases.On Friday, Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden’s national security adviser, put the buildup in strategic terms, saying the war in Ukraine had exposed shortfalls in the nation’s military industrial base that needed to be addressed to ensure the United States is “able to support Ukraine and to be able to deal with contingencies elsewhere in the world.”Lockheed Martin, the nation’s largest military contractor, had booked more than $950 million worth of its own missile military orders from the Pentagon in part to refill stockpiles being used in Ukraine. 
1580	The Army has awarded Raytheon Technologies more than $2 billion in contracts to deliver missile systems to expand or replenish weapons used to help Ukraine.
1581	“We went through six years of Stingers in 10 months,” Gregory J. Hayes, Raytheon’s chief executive, said in an interview earlier this month, referring to 1,600 of the company’s shoulder-fired antiaircraft missiles sent by the U.S. government to Ukraine. 
1582	“So it will take us multiple years to restock and replenish.”But those contracts are just the leading edge of what is shaping up to be a big new defense buildup. 
1583	Military spending next year is on track to reach its highest level in inflation-adjusted terms since the peaks in the costs of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars between 2008 and 2011, and the second highest in inflation-adjusted terms since World War II — a level that is more than the budgets for the next 10 largest cabinet agencies combined.Even more orders are coming in to military contractors from U.S. allies in Europe and Asia, as they too have concluded they must do more to arm themselves against rising global threats. 
1584	Japan moved this month to double its spending on defense over the next five years, putting aside a pacifist stand it has largely maintained since 1945.And none of this counts an estimated $18 billion of planned but now delayed weapons deliveries by the United States to arm Taiwan against a possible future attack by China.The combination of the Ukraine war and the growing consensus about the emergence of a new era of superpower confrontation is prompting efforts to ensure the military industrial base can respond to surges in demand. 
1585	The issue has become urgent in some cases as the U.S. and its NATO allies seek to keep weapons flowing to Ukraine without diminishing their own stocks to worrisome levels.The Ukrainian military has run through years’ worth of the missile production capacity of Western suppliers in a matter of months. 
1586	At the same time, contractors remain concerned about investing to meet growing demand for weapons that could dry up again when the war ends or politics shifts course.
1587	“The difficulty of starting a production line back up, that doesn’t come for free,” Tom Arseneault, president of BAE Systems, which is now considering restarting its M777 howitzer manufacturing line, which the company had been in the process of shutting down. 
1588	The M777 is a highly accurate, towed gun that fires 155-millimeter artillery shells, which are also in diminishing supply.The annual military authorization bill that passed the Senate on Thursday prevents the Air Force and Navy from retiring aging weapons systems that the military would like to take out of service, including certain C-130 transport planes or F-22 fighter jets. 
1589	At the same time, it includes billions of dollars in extra money to build even more new ships and planes than the Pentagon itself asked for, including $2.2 billion alone for an extra Navy-guided missile destroyer, according to the Senate Armed Services Committee.And there is $678 million to expand ammunition plants in spots such as Scranton, Pa.
1590	; Middletown, Iowa; and Kingsport, Tenn., where contractors work with the Army to manufacture the ammunition that Ukrainian artillery crews have burned through at an alarming rate. 
1591	(The money for these programs is expected to be included in a huge appropriations bill that appears to be on track to pass Congress and signed into law by Mr. Biden by the end of the week.)Spending could be even higher, as Congress is also considering a request for an extra $21.7 billion for the Pentagon, above the already expanded 2023 annual budget, to allocate more money to resupply materials used in Ukraine.In an indication of how government policy is shifting to rebuild industrial capacity for the military, Congress this year has moved to allow the Defense Department to more broadly make multiyear spending commitments for certain weapons systems and shipbuilding operations. 
1592	That is a provision that industry lobbyists have long pushed for, arguing it gives companies certainty that investments they make to start production will see continued returns in future years.
1593	“We have to make a commitment with the industry,” said Senator Deb Fischer, Republican of Nebraska and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who supported the change. 
1594	“Then the industry will step forward to restart or grow their production lines.”That move alone suggests $73 billion in additional munitions orders could be on the way in the next three years, contracts that will largely benefit the big players like Lockheed and Raytheon, according to an analysis by Myles Walton, a military industry analyst at Wolfe Research, a Wall Street research firm.These trends help explain stock market performance of the major military contractors — a small group of which control the bulk of sales to the Pentagon. 
1595	Lockheed and Northrop Grumman both have seen their stock prices jump more than 35 percent so far this year in a market whose main indexes are down overall for the year.Opponents of higher military budgets say they are frustrated.Military contractors are “riding high again, and Ukraine just gives them another argument as to why things need to continue onward and upward,” said William D. Hartung, a fellow at the non-interventionist Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft.
1596	“The trillion-dollar defense budget — that is where we are headed,” said Lawrence J. Korb, who served as an assistant defense secretary during the Reagan administration and was once a vice president at Raytheon. 
1597	“Nobody seems to want to make the tough choices. Even the Democrats now seem to be afraid to be seen as being soft on defense.”The biggest barrier for growth for major military contractors — the list includes Lockheed, Raytheon, Boeing, General Dynamics, BAE, Northrop Grumman and Huntington Ingalls Industries — is finding sufficient supplies of key components, such as microelectronics and missile warheads, as well as a steady supply of new employees to assemble all these items.
1598	“You cannot throw much more money at the seven shipbuilders that build U.S. warships in the United States of America right now,” Adm. Michael M. Gilday, the chief of naval operations, said this month during the Reagan National Defense Forum in California, referring to a $32.6 billion shipbuilding budget in the military authorization bill that is $4.7 billion more than the Pentagon requested. 
1599	“Their capacity is about at max. And Congress is helping us max them out.”Raytheon, which has 180,000 workers, has hired 27,000 new employees so far this year, its chief executive said in October. 
1600	But even with that, it is still running into bottlenecks in terms of available parts and labor shortages that are slowing sales, its executives said.The sheer scale of the munitions and missiles sent to Ukraine illustrates just how much matériel a war can consume.That includes more than 104 million rounds of small-arms ammunition, at least one million rounds of 155-millimeter artillery shells, 46,000 anti-tank weapons, more than 1,600 Stinger antiaircraft missiles and 8,500 Javelin anti-armor missiles, according to a Pentagon tally.The resupply challenge is not just a matter of money. 
1601	Military contractors have nearly stopped manufacturing Stingers — Raytheon’s last contract from the U.S. government was in 2002, Mr. Haynes said. 
1602	And while Javelins are still being made jointly by Raytheon and Lockheed — in September they were awarded a $311 million contract to deliver more of them — historically they have been able to make only about 2,100 a year, or about a quarter of what Ukraine has burned through since the outbreak of the war in February.In total, the Pentagon as of early December had awarded at least $6 billion to military contractors to resupply these and other items sent to Ukraine.
1603	“We’re going to ramp up,” Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said this month. 
1604	“We’ve really been working closely with industry to both increase their capacity and also the speed at which they’re able to produce.”The overall spending on national defense still remains relatively low as a percentage of the nation’s economy: about 3.2 percent of the gross domestic product this year, compared to 37 percent during World War II and 13 percent during the Korean War, according to Pentagon records.Still, companies are scrambling to avoid or resolve bottlenecks caused by the increase in demand.Lockheed, for example, spent more than $60 million of its own money in advance of getting Pentagon contract commitment to build more of its High Mobility Artillery Rocket System vehicles, or HIMARS, which fire guided rockets carrying 200 pounds of explosives that can hit targets nearly 50 miles away. 
1605	The vehicles have been much sought after by Ukraine, which has used them to devastating effect against the Russians.Traditionally, Lockheed has been able to build 60 of these trucks per year, but it is now shifting production to 24 hours a day and seven days a week in an effort to bring that annual total to 96 units. 
1606	It also now has a new $430 million contract to deliver more HIMARS, along with a new $521 million contract to build more of the rockets, called GMLRS, that these vehicles can fire.These resupply orders, while large in terms of many other contracts the federal government issues, are still relatively small for the biggest contractors. 
1607	At Lockheed, for example, about 70 percent of sales come from the U.S. government, and most of the rest from other governments worldwide. 
1608	Supply chain and labor shortage problems are cutting into sales and profits, including at Lockheed, which expects to see annual sales decline this year to $62.3 billion from $67 billion.
1609	“The clutch is engaging but into some lower gears initially,” James Taiclet, Lockheed’s chief executive, said in October, adding that higher sales might not show up for another year.But there are more of the big-ticket orders coming. 
1610	In the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Switzerland and Germany have both moved in recent months to finalize orders for the F-35 fighter jets, collectively worth $16 billion. 
1611	Overall foreign military sales notifications to Congress so far in 2022 have totaled $81 billion, the third highest figure in the last 25 years, with an increasing share of these sales going to European and Asian nations.Next year’s military budget also includes major investments in new hypersonic weapons that are also being aggressively pursued by China. 
1612	Raytheon and Northrop Grumman in September won a $1 billion contract just to build prototypes for the Air Force.Other companies want to replace older equipment sent to Ukraine with newer models. 
1613	BAE, for example, intends to sell the Army more armored vehicles called AMPVs, in place of the more than 200 of BAE’s Vietnam-era M113 armored personnel carriers sent to Ukraine, which it no longer makes.
1614	“Nothing’s cheap, right?” said Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro  this month at the conference in California, as he ran through many new investments the Navy is making. 
1615	“Nothing’s free.”Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.
1616	When Chris Licht told his boss, Stephen Colbert, the host of the CBS program “Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” in February that he had been offered the chief executive job at CNN, Mr. Colbert was blunt: “Definitely don’t go do that.”But for Mr. Licht, nothing less than democracy itself was at stake. 
1617	He argued he could make CNN a news channel that people trusted, as opposed to one that monetized partisan combat.
1618	“Oh, man, you used to be in news, remember?” 
1619	Mr. Colbert recalled telling him. 
1620	“You said this was so much nicer — 12 weeks off, good pay, laugh for an hour every night. Everyone is really nice; you can say anything you want, and nobody leaks it. It’s great.”“CNN would be lucky to get you,” Mr. Colbert continued. 
1621	“But you’re my friend, and I’m telling you not to go.”“This is a calling,” Mr. Licht countered.At which point Mr. Colbert stopped trying to dissuade him: “I can’t negotiate with a calling.”On Feb. 28, Mr. Licht was named CNN’s new chief executive. 
1622	Since then, he and Mr. Colbert have spoken nearly every Friday. 
1623	Each time, Mr. Colbert begins with the same four words:“I told you so.”By almost any measure, Mr. Licht, 51, has had a rough start. 
1624	His first major act was to kill the network’s fledgling streaming service, CNN+, and fire 400 or so people working on it. 
1625	CNN’s revenue and profits have plunged to a projected $750 million this year, down from $1.25 billion last year, partly from the costs associated with CNN+, the network acknowledged. 
1626	CNN’s ratings declined, on average, this year compared with 2021, according to Nielsen, with CNN falling behind MSNBC for the first time in prime time on election night among total viewers. 
1627	(CNN prevailed in the coveted 25-to-54 age group.)At the end of November, Mr. Licht levied another round of job cuts — this time just under 10 percent of CNN’s work force of about 4,000, which plunged morale further. 
1628	Among the casualties were familiar commentators like Chris Cillizza, key behind-the-scenes producers with decades of experience, and the entirety of HLN, CNN’s sister network, and its popular morning host, Robin Meade.A chorus of media pundits has pounced on every tidbit of bad news. 
1629	Mr. Licht’s early programming efforts aimed at repositioning the network as broader and less partisan have prompted howls of criticism, with former MSNBC host and former colleague Keith Olbermann publicly calling Mr. Licht a “TV Fascist” after he moved Don Lemon, a liberal host, from a prime-time slot to a revamped morning show.
1630	“The uninformed vitriol, especially from the left, has been stunning,” Mr. Licht said in one of several interviews with The New York Times spanning his nearly eight-month tenure. 
1631	“Which proves my point: so much of what passes for news is name-calling, half-truths and desperation.”Mr. 
1632	Licht said he was under no illusion that stepping into the chief executive job would be easy or make him popular. 
1633	The network’s previous parent, the telecommunications giant AT&T, had just spun off its Warner Media subsidiary, which included CNN, into a new company run by Discovery’s chief executive, David Zaslav.Just two months before the companies merged and only weeks before CNN+ was introduced to the world, the network’s popular and longtime chief executive, Jeff Zucker, was forced to resign after failing to disclose a romantic relationship with his top lieutenant, Allison Gollust. 
1634	Some at CNN felt Mr. Zucker had been unfairly sacrificed and remained staunchly loyal to their former boss.CNN had also become the poster child for the poisoned relationship between former President Donald J. Trump and mainstream media organizations. 
1635	Mr. Trump repeatedly branded CNN as “fake news,” and his administration engaged in open warfare with CNN correspondents like Jim Acosta, whom Mr. Trump once called “a rude, terrible person” during a news conference. 
1636	In 2018, CNN’s New York headquarters had to be evacuated after a bomb threat.CNN remained enviably profitable, earning over $1 billion a year for the past five years. 
1637	But cable news, along with all cable channels, has been in secular decline, troubled by shifting viewer habits in an era of cord cutting and an exodus to streaming services and online news sites.It’s not clear anyone could surmount those challenges, let alone someone who’d just spent nearly six years at a late-night entertainment show and had never managed a complex, globe-spanning organization with thousands of employees.So why even take the job?
1638	Mr. 
1639	Licht seemed to have TV news in his DNA. 
1640	As a child, he’d created a fictional TV news network, WBC, and produced his own newscast using a VCR camera in his basement in Newtown, Conn. 
1641	At about the age of 9, he met the NBC legal correspondent Carl Stern on a family vacation and, in Mr. Licht’s telling, “stuck to him like glue.” 
1642	Mr. Licht pried the newsman’s phone number from him and used it regularly. 
1643	“I was obsessed,” Mr. Licht said. 
1644	After college at Syracuse University, Mr. Licht landed jobs at NBC affiliates in Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
1645	As a reporter and producer, he covered a mass shooting in San Bernardino, the plane crash that killed John F. Kennedy Jr., two presidential campaigns and three Olympics.In 2005, he moved to NBC’s sibling network, MSNBC, soon becoming an executive producer for “Morning Joe,” which he helped develop into an improbable success in its hotly competitive morning time slot. 
1646	Notably, the two hosts, the former Republican politician Joe Scarborough and the more liberal former CBS correspondent Mika Brzezinski, straddled the political divide. 
1647	The tension between them seemed to enhance their audience appeal. 
1648	Mr. Licht encouraged them to be themselves and embrace the unexpected. 
1649	(They later married.)Mr. 
1650	Licht moved to CBS in 2010, where he’d scored another early morning success. 
1651	He lifted ratings at the perennial also-ran “CBS This Morning” on the strength of the program’s three hosts, Charlie Rose, Gayle King and Norah O’Donnell, and an emphasis on news and in-depth interviews, rather than the lighter fare format of its competitors “Today” and “Good Morning America.”After having a brain aneurysm in 2010 when he was still under 40, Mr. Licht wrote a book about what he learned from the experience, while still describing himself as a “killer TV producer” with “no urge to surrender my spot in the fast lane,” even after the near-fatal incident.Restless after six years at “This Morning,” in 2016 he joined the then-faltering CBS program “Late Show With Stephen Colbert.” 
1652	Within a year, Mr. Colbert had seized the late-night ratings crown from Jimmy Fallon of NBC’s “Tonight Show.”Soon after the Warner-Discovery deal was announced, Mr. Zaslav summoned Mr. Licht to Discovery’s headquarters in Manhattan on 19th Street and asked what he thought of CNN.Mr. 
1653	Licht told him he had no interest in running it. 
1654	“I got out of news, and I’m not going back,” Mr. Licht had insisted.Mr. 
1655	Zaslav ignored the demurral. 
1656	Over the next several weeks, he kept making the case to Mr. Licht. 
1657	In fact, Mr. Zaslav said in an interview that he never considered anyone else for the job.The two men have known each other for 15 years, since both were working at NBC, where Mr. Zaslav helped start MSNBC. 
1658	In the years since, they have had breakfast once a quarter. 
1659	Mr. Licht has looked to Mr. Zaslav as a mentor, and Mr. Zaslav has admired Mr. Licht’s work ethic and drive.
1660	“He’s a fighter, and he likes to win,” Mr. Zaslav said.At their first meeting, Mr. Zaslav argued that running CNN would be “a great opportunity to build the No. 1 news brand in the world,” and “the most trusted brand in news where people go every day and in a crisis for the best version of the truth.”And more than that: “This is important for America. It’s important for a functioning society.”Mr. 
1661	Licht and Mr. Zaslav — not to mention Warner’s largest shareholder, the media mogul John Malone — were philosophically aligned. 
1662	Fox and MSNBC were “advocacy” networks, as Mr. Zaslav put it, a proven business model appealing to like-minded viewers but of scant, if any, value as a public service. 
1663	Whether by design or happenstance, he believed CNN had tacked left, a pale version of MSNBC that nonetheless alienated wide parts of the American electorate with a focus on politics and the president at the time, Mr. Trump.Ted Turner’s mantra had always been “the news is the star.” 
1664	Mr. Trump “is not the star,” Mr. Zaslav said.Yet Mr. Licht was noncommittal. 
1665	On a subsequent phone call, Mr. Zaslav urged Mr. Licht to think about CNN and whether he’d be interested in the top job. 
1666	After Mr. Licht hung up, his wife, Jennifer Blanco Licht, a former TV executive herself, asked: “Is this crazy? I think you should do it.”The two men continued the conversation on a long walk in Central Park. 
1667	(They both live near the park.) 
1668	During that conversation, Mr. Zaslav warned Mr. Licht that he’d be closely scrutinized and judged harshly. 
1669	Is your family ready for this? 
1670	Are you ready for this? 
1671	Because “it will be brutal,” Mr. Zaslav said.Mr. 
1672	Licht said he doesn’t recall Mr. Zaslav ever offering him the job, or his accepting it. 
1673	At one point, Mr. Zaslav simply asked, “Who’s your lawyer?” and started acting like Mr. Licht was CNN’s future chief executive. 
1674	A contract ensued.On their first lunch afterward, at Mr. Zaslav’s usual corner table at Gramercy Tavern, Mr. Zaslav indicated their yearslong relationship had fundamentally changed. 
1675	“We’ve been friends for 15 years,” Mr. Zaslav said. 
1676	“We’re not friends any more. You work for me.”Almost immediately, their shared vision of saving democracy ran into the harsh reality of cable news economics.With Fox News and MSNBC having already staked out the right and left ends of the political spectrum, attracting the middle (what Mr. Licht referred to as “normal” people) has proved elusive. 
1677	Mr. Zaslav had stressed that he didn’t care — at least not much — about CNN’s current ratings, revenue or profitability. 
1678	He recognized that it would take years to reposition and rebuild the network. 
1679	But even he had his limits.AT&T’s board had approved an ambitious budget of $350 million for CNN+, much of it already spent by the time Mr. Licht arrived. 
1680	Many more millions would be needed. 
1681	With Warner facing pressure from Wall Street to find $3 billion in savings, on April 21, Mr. Licht killed the streaming service after less than a month on air.In an effort to restore morale and calm anxiety, Mr. Licht assured CNN employees at a network-wide town hall meeting on May 5 that Warner Bros. 
1682	Discovery didn’t anticipate further job cuts at CNN because there was no overlap between the news network and Discovery’s cable channels, and thus there wasn’t anyone else doing the same jobs that would need to be cut. 
1683	In a series of additional town hall meetings, most of them leaked almost immediately to The New York Times and other news outlets, Mr. Licht also laid the groundwork for the network’s shift to broader, less political and less partisan coverage. 
1684	This was not, he stressed repeatedly, a move to the “center,” a boring, political neutral zone that Mr. Licht wasn’t even sure existed. 
1685	Rather, it was an attempt to explore controversial issues from varied perspectives — not to tell people “what to think,” as he put it, but “how to think,” or what he called a “blueprint for how to make decisions.”In July, Mr. Licht made a highly symbolic pilgrimage to Capitol Hill noteworthy for its inclusion of Republicans like the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, and Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas. 
1686	Although he spent equal time with Democratic leaders like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Mr. Licht was irritated that his visit was billed as an “apology tour” and effort to coax Republicans back onto the network — part of CNN’s perceived move to the right.After long absences, several Republicans have since appeared on CNN, including Mr. McCarthy and Senator Rick Scott of Florida.Featuring hosts and guests with opposing points of view and playing up controversy has paid ratings dividends on cable in the past, notably on CNN’s own “Crossfire,” which came under criticism for evolving into to a verbal food fight criticized by the comedian Jon Stewart as “hurting America.”But Mr. Licht said he wasn’t interested in controversy for its own sake, but to offer a “rational conversation about polarizing issues.” 
1687	After watching CNN, he hopes people will “take what they’ve heard to the dinner table and have a discussion,” he said. 
1688	“That’s a dream of mine.”Two examples have been coverage of the abortion debate in the wake of the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade, and the debate over gun rights. 
1689	To vocal criticism from the left, he hired Stephen Gutowski, founder and editor of The Reload, a firearms website. 
1690	No one wants a school shooting, said Mr. Licht, whose hometown, Newtown, was the site of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre. 
1691	“But we have to understand the culture of people who like guns,” he said.
1692	“This is not vanilla, centrist or boring,” he added.Mr. 
1693	Licht has barely begun to put his stamp on the network’s programming, but it’s already evident in the new morning show, “CNN This Morning.” 
1694	Mr. Licht picked the hosts, persuading the left-leaning Don Lemon to trade his prime-time slot for early morning, and pairing him with the former Daily Caller reporter and CNN White House correspondent Kaitlan Collins and Poppy Harlow, a former host of “CNN Newsroom.” 
1695	The show takes a somewhat similar approach to the one he used at “CBS This Morning” (which also shares a near-identical name).
1696	In a series of interviews with The Times, Mr. Licht visibly came to life talking about “This Morning” and its co-hosts. 
1697	“They obviously like each other,” he said. 
1698	“The chemistry is great. I love the collaboration. Every day, it evolves. It’s not like me giving orders. It’s so much fun.”“This Morning” debuted on Nov. 1. 
1699	The New York Post (which shares ownership with CNN’s rival, Fox News) reported the next day that “‘CNN This Morning’ bombs in debut,” drawing just 387,000 viewers, far behind rival morning shows and trailing its predecessor on CNN, “New Day.” 
1700	CNN called the instant critique “absurd and cheap” after just one day’s data. 
1701	(Since then, the show has gained slightly among total viewers.) 
1702	More significantly, Mr. Licht noted, “This Morning” has broken news, including the chief Washington correspondent Jake Tapper’s scoop that Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona was leaving the Democratic Party to become an Independent.Prime time looms as an even greater challenge. 
1703	In August, Mr. Licht moved Mr. Tapper from his 4 p.m. anchor position to the coveted 9 p.m. slot that had been vacated by Chris Cuomo after CNN fired him for what it deemed inappropriate efforts to help his brother, New York’s former governor, Andrew Cuomo, fend off the sexual harassment allegations that led to his resignation from office. 
1704	The experiment with Mr. Tapper fared poorly in the ratings and lasted just one month.Mr. 
1705	Licht acknowledged that prime time remains an “open canvas.” 
1706	He said he and his colleagues were meeting and “throwing things against the wall, looking at off-the-beaten path opportunities.” 
1707	Among the names tossed out have been entertainment, comedy and sports figures. 
1708	He declined to be more specific but promised surprises.Miklos Sarvary, a professor and director of the media and technology program at Columbia Business School, said that entertainment was potentially more profitable than low-margin news. 
1709	“But what does that do to the brand if you want to be the most trusted name in news?” he said. 
1710	“News is supposed to be serious. I’m not sure that putting on a comedian is a great move for credibility.”Mr. 
1711	Licht said he understood Mr. Sarvary’s point, but said prime time offered “some leeway for being a little different.”“It has to be compelling and entertaining without hurting the news brand,” he said, citing his former boss Mr. Colbert, and Mr. Stewart as “the kind of people who’d work,” while acknowledging that Mr. Stewart is already locked into a lucrative contract at Apple TV.Every Saturday, Mr. Licht sends Mr. Zaslav a memo with highlights of the week and programming and financial updates. 
1712	Mr. Licht’s growth strategy is focused on CNN.com, which attracts more than 200 million unique visitors each month, according to CNN. 
1713	But at its peak, CNN digital generated only about 10 percent of the network’s profits, Mr. Licht confirmed.On Oct. 13, Mr. Licht made his debut in front of Warner Brother Discovery’s board at a hotel in Los Angeles, where he outlined both his growth and content strategy. 
1714	Asked about his efforts to make CNN less partisan, Mr. Licht gave this analogy: Suppose it’s raining outside. 
1715	CNN plans to have people on who love the rain, and it will have people on who say they don’t like the rain. 
1716	But it won’t have anyone on who says it’s sunny out.Mr. 
1717	Licht said he used the analogy to make clear that a less-partisan CNN did not mean it was any less committed to truth. 
1718	“This wasn’t to plot a new course but to assure people we would not let up one inch in being truth tellers,” he said. 
1719	“The change is we will not do Trump 24/7 or let him dictate our agenda.”By all accounts, Mr. Licht’s presentation was warmly received by directors, including Mr. Malone.Mr. 
1720	Licht’s vision is contending with industrywide pressures to cut costs. 
1721	(He said he appreciates but doesn’t really believe Mr. Zaslav’s professed indifference to financial results.) 
1722	By announcing the need for more layoffs on Oct. 26, he said he hoped to engage in a “transparent” process that would leave everyone feeling they’d been heard. 
1723	But, he said, “it would be irresponsible not to do the tough work now.” 
1724	He added, “I promise you CNN will be more profitable next year.”However transparent, many in CNN’s rank and file felt blindsided by the cuts, especially after what they perceived as his earlier reassurances that no further layoffs would be needed. 
1725	In a all-staff meeting in November, Mr. Licht said he stood by his earlier remark that there would be no merger-related layoffs, and “I absolutely would not have said something that I did not believe to be true.” 
1726	But he said he understood how his remarks had hurt his credibility. 
1727	“I have to win that credibility back,” he acknowledged.Mr. 
1728	Licht said the firings were the “low point” of his tenure so far.At another all-staff meeting this month, aimed at restoring morale, Mr. Licht took questions and then ended with a passage he wrote himself:In terms of morale, let me just say, you work at a world-renowned news organization alongside the best journalists on the globe. 
1729	Your jobs have meaning. 
1730	Your jobs have an impact. 
1731	You are part of something bigger, of something with tremendous meaning. 
1732	And nothing about that has changed. 
1733	And you have in me as a leader, who has done a lot of your jobs, someone who has your back every step of the way. 
1734	My loyalty is first and foremost to this organization and to journalism without fear or favor to anyone else, including our parent company.That’s why I’m here. 
1735	That’s why I took this job.
1736	“I want CNN to be essential to society,” Mr. Licht said in one of our interviews. 
1737	“If you’re essential then the revenue will follow.”And if it doesn’t?
1738	“Maybe it won’t work,” Mr. Licht conceded. 
1739	“But I’d rather try to win this way.”Benjamin Mullin and Michael M. Grynbaum contributed reporting.
1740	A well-known Catholic priest and incendiary leader of the anti-abortion movement was removed from the priesthood by the Vatican, according to a letter from Pope Francis’ representative to the United States that was obtained by The New York Times.Frank Pavone, who leads the advocacy organization Priests for Life, and was once a religious adviser to former President Donald J. Trump, was dismissed from the clergy on Nov. 9 with no possibility of appeal, the letter states. 
1741	The letter included a statement about the removal, called laicization, that it said was approved by the Dicastery for the Clergy, a Vatican office.
1742	“This action was taken after Father Pavone was found guilty in canonical proceedings of blasphemous communications on social media, and of persistent disobedience of the lawful instructions of his diocesan bishop,” it states.The letter did not specify those communications or disobedience, or name the diocesan bishop.  
1743	Reached by phone on Sunday morning, Mr. Pavone said that he had not been properly notified of the decision.
1744	“I’m waiting for them to point out to me what I did wrong that merits something like this,” he said. 
1745	And though the Vatican has said there was no possibility of appeal, Mr. Pavone said that ultimately he and his allies “would have to appeal to the next pope” and “to the people of God.”The punishment of a high-profile Catholic anti-abortion activist comes at a precarious moment for the movement as it plans its future after losses in the midterm election and struggles to unify Republicans around the issue. 
1746	Mr. Pavone’s anti-abortion activism was not cited in the letter as the reason for his dismissal.The move also comes a month after the Catholic bishops of the United States said they would redouble their efforts to end abortion and elected new leaders who are expected to continue the conservative leanings of the hierarchy.Mr. 
1747	Pavone, a ubiquitous figure at anti-abortion rallies and fund-raisers, is prolific on social media. 
1748	By his own account, his outspoken anti-abortion activism has won the support of some church leaders over the years but has also led to clashes with others.He is also known in the anti-abortion movement for his relationship with Norma McCorvey, the ‘Jane Roe’ of Roe v. Wade, whose lawsuit led to the U.S. Supreme Court decision nearly 50 years ago to enshrine the right to abortion in the Constitution. 
1749	Ms. McCorvey later converted to Catholicism and the anti-abortion cause, at least for a time. 
1750	The court rescinded the right this summer.Mr. 
1751	Pavone was devoted to Mr. Trump and was among those who questioned the results of the 2020 election.His dismissal was first reported by the conservative outlet Catholic News Agency on Saturday night.On a live broadcast on social media shortly after the report, Mr. Pavone said he had received no communication from the Vatican about his removal. 
1752	Wearing a leather jacket over his priest’s collar, he said he would continue his work for the anti-abortion cause.
1753	“I’ve been persecuted in the church for decades, decades. This is nothing new for me,” he said. 
1754	“They just don’t like the work I’m doing for these babies.”He seemed to refer to a comment on Twitter from 2020 in which he referred to “supporters of this goddamn loser Biden and his morally corrupt, America-hating, God hating Democrat party.”“I used the word G-D in a response to somebody in a tweet and for that they want to throw me out of the priesthood,” he said.The letter about his removal makes no specific reference to this incident, or to abortion beyond his affiliation.Online, Mr. Pavone seemed to compare his removal itself to abortion.
1755	“In every profession, including the priesthood, if you defend the #unborn, you will be treated like them!” he wrote on Twitter on Saturday night. 
1756	“The only difference is that when we are ‘aborted,’ we continue to speak, loud and clear.”Archbishop Christophe Pierre, the Pope’s representative to the United States, called the apostolic nuncio, addressed the letter dated Dec. 13 to bishops, alerting them of the decision from the Vatican. 
1757	The New York Times obtained the letter from a person who had access to it but who was not authorized to share it.
1758	“As you will know, Father Pavone was a very public and high profile figure associated with the Right to Life Movement in the U.S.,” Archbishop Pierre states. 
1759	“His dismissal from the clerical state may, therefore, be a matter of interest among the faithful. In anticipation of that potential interest, the attached statement regarding Father Pavone is provided for your information.”The statement said that Mr. Pavone was given “ample opportunity to defend himself” as well as “multiple opportunities to submit himself to the authority of his diocesan bishop.”“It was determined that Father Pavone had no reasonable justification for his actions,” it says.The statement said the future of Mr. Pavone’s role at Priests for Life would be entirely up to the group, which it described as “not a Catholic organization.”In his broadcast, Mr. Pavone said, “You can’t cancel this message, you won’t silence this message. It’s only going to grow. We’re only going to get louder.”During the 2016 presidential election, Mr. Pavone posted a live video on Facebook in which he put an aborted fetus on what appeared to be an altar. 
1760	The Diocese of Amarillo in Texas, which oversaw him at the time, announced that it opened an investigation into Mr. Pavone as a result. 
1761	The diocese did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday night.Mr. 
1762	Pavone clashed publicly with the bishop of the Diocese of Amarillo, Patrick Zurek, several times over the years. 
1763	In the fall of 2020, the diocese issued a statement saying Catholics should disregard Mr. Pavone’s rhetoric about the election, including comments online about withholding the absolution of sin from Catholics who voted Democratic.
1764	“These postings are not consistent with Catholic Church Teachings,” the diocese said in a statement at the time. 
1765	“Please disregard them and pray for Father Pavone.”In the interview on Sunday, Mr. Pavone said that he believed the removal process stemmed from the Amarillo investigation. 
1766	He said that he had previously told church authorities he would not participate in the process, which he saw as “tainted.” 
1767	Following the report of his dismissal, Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, defended Mr. Pavone as “the one priest devoted most over the years” to taking action and building support for the anti-abortion cause, and said that she would continue to lean on him going forward.
1768	“He and I see it the same way: This is the very beginning of the pro-life movement, and he has only just gotten started,” she said. 
1769	Eric Scheidler, the executive director of the Pro-Life Action League, which has a long relationship with Mr. Pavone, said it was “hard to see an organization called Priests for Life headed by a man who’s not recognized as a priest by any local bishop.”Mr. 
1770	Pavone’s removal could rattle his fellow activists at a sensitive time, said Mr. Scheidler, who is Catholic.
1771	“It’s a time of real soul-searching and challenges for the pro-life movement as we try to rebuild after the backlash to the overturning of Roe v. Wade,” he said.
1772	By Eric Lipton, Michael Crowley and John IsmayWASHINGTON — The prospect of growing military threats from both China and Russia is driving bipartisan support for a surge in Pentagon spending, setting up another potential boom for weapons makers that is likely to extend beyond the war in Ukraine.Congress is on track in the coming week to give final approval to a national military budget for the current fiscal year that is expected to reach approximately $858 billion — or $45 billion above what President Biden had requested.If approved at this level, the Pentagon budget will have grown at 4.3 percent per year over the last two years — even after inflation — compared with an average of less than 1 percent a year in real dollars between 2015 and 2021, according to an analysis by Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments for The New York Times.Spending on procurement would rise sharply next year, including a 55 percent jump in Army funding to buy new missiles and a 47 percent jump for the Navy’s weapons purchases.On Friday, Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden’s national security adviser, put the buildup in strategic terms, saying the war in Ukraine had exposed shortfalls in the nation’s military industrial base that needed to be addressed to ensure the United States is “able to support Ukraine and to be able to deal with contingencies elsewhere in the world.”Lockheed Martin, the nation’s largest military contractor, had booked more than $950 million worth of its own missile military orders from the Pentagon in part to refill stockpiles being used in Ukraine. 
1773	The Army has awarded Raytheon Technologies more than $2 billion in contracts to deliver missile systems to expand or replenish weapons used to help Ukraine.
1774	“We went through six years of Stingers in 10 months,” Gregory J. Hayes, Raytheon’s chief executive, said in an interview earlier this month, referring to 1,600 of the company’s shoulder-fired antiaircraft missiles sent by the U.S. government to Ukraine. 
1775	“So it will take us multiple years to restock and replenish.”But those contracts are just the leading edge of what is shaping up to be a big new defense buildup. 
1776	Military spending next year is on track to reach its highest level in inflation-adjusted terms since the peaks in the costs of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars between 2008 and 2011, and the second highest in inflation-adjusted terms since World War II — a level that is more than the budgets for the next 10 largest cabinet agencies combined.Even more orders are coming in to military contractors from U.S. allies in Europe and Asia, as they too have concluded they must do more to arm themselves against rising global threats. 
1777	Japan moved this month to double its spending on defense over the next five years, putting aside a pacifist stand it has largely maintained since 1945.And none of this counts an estimated $18 billion of planned but now delayed weapons deliveries by the United States to arm Taiwan against a possible future attack by China.The combination of the Ukraine war and the growing consensus about the emergence of a new era of superpower confrontation is prompting efforts to ensure the military industrial base can respond to surges in demand. 
1778	The issue has become urgent in some cases as the U.S. and its NATO allies seek to keep weapons flowing to Ukraine without diminishing their own stocks to worrisome levels.The Ukrainian military has run through years’ worth of the missile production capacity of Western suppliers in a matter of months. 
1779	At the same time, contractors remain concerned about investing to meet growing demand for weapons that could dry up again when the war ends or politics shifts course.
1780	“The difficulty of starting a production line back up, that doesn’t come for free,” Tom Arseneault, president of BAE Systems, which is now considering restarting its M777 howitzer manufacturing line, which the company had been in the process of shutting down. 
1781	The M777 is a highly accurate, towed gun that fires 155-millimeter artillery shells, which are also in diminishing supply.The annual military authorization bill that passed the Senate on Thursday prevents the Air Force and Navy from retiring aging weapons systems that the military would like to take out of service, including certain C-130 transport planes or F-22 fighter jets. 
1782	At the same time, it includes billions of dollars in extra money to build even more new ships and planes than the Pentagon itself asked for, including $2.2 billion alone for an extra Navy-guided missile destroyer, according to the Senate Armed Services Committee.And there is $678 million to expand ammunition plants in spots such as Scranton, Pa.
1783	; Middletown, Iowa; and Kingsport, Tenn., where contractors work with the Army to manufacture the ammunition that Ukrainian artillery crews have burned through at an alarming rate. 
1784	(The money for these programs is expected to be included in a huge appropriations bill that appears to be on track to pass Congress and signed into law by Mr. Biden by the end of the week.)Spending could be even higher, as Congress is also considering a request for an extra $21.7 billion for the Pentagon, above the already expanded 2023 annual budget, to allocate more money to resupply materials used in Ukraine.In an indication of how government policy is shifting to rebuild industrial capacity for the military, Congress this year has moved to allow the Defense Department to more broadly make multiyear spending commitments for certain weapons systems and shipbuilding operations. 
1785	That is a provision that industry lobbyists have long pushed for, arguing it gives companies certainty that investments they make to start production will see continued returns in future years.
1786	“We have to make a commitment with the industry,” said Senator Deb Fischer, Republican of Nebraska and a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, who supported the change. 
1787	“Then the industry will step forward to restart or grow their production lines.”That move alone suggests $73 billion in additional munitions orders could be on the way in the next three years, contracts that will largely benefit the big players like Lockheed and Raytheon, according to an analysis by Myles Walton, a military industry analyst at Wolfe Research, a Wall Street research firm.These trends help explain stock market performance of the major military contractors — a small group of which control the bulk of sales to the Pentagon. 
1788	Lockheed and Northrop Grumman both have seen their stock prices jump more than 35 percent so far this year in a market whose main indexes are down overall for the year.Opponents of higher military budgets say they are frustrated.Military contractors are “riding high again, and Ukraine just gives them another argument as to why things need to continue onward and upward,” said William D. Hartung, a fellow at the non-interventionist Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft.
1789	“The trillion-dollar defense budget — that is where we are headed,” said Lawrence J. Korb, who served as an assistant defense secretary during the Reagan administration and was once a vice president at Raytheon. 
1790	“Nobody seems to want to make the tough choices. Even the Democrats now seem to be afraid to be seen as being soft on defense.”The biggest barrier for growth for major military contractors — the list includes Lockheed, Raytheon, Boeing, General Dynamics, BAE, Northrop Grumman and Huntington Ingalls Industries — is finding sufficient supplies of key components, such as microelectronics and missile warheads, as well as a steady supply of new employees to assemble all these items.
1791	“You cannot throw much more money at the seven shipbuilders that build U.S. warships in the United States of America right now,” Adm. Michael M. Gilday, the chief of naval operations, said this month during the Reagan National Defense Forum in California, referring to a $32.6 billion shipbuilding budget in the military authorization bill that is $4.7 billion more than the Pentagon requested. 
1792	“Their capacity is about at max. And Congress is helping us max them out.”Raytheon, which has 180,000 workers, has hired 27,000 new employees so far this year, its chief executive said in October. 
1793	But even with that, it is still running into bottlenecks in terms of available parts and labor shortages that are slowing sales, its executives said.The sheer scale of the munitions and missiles sent to Ukraine illustrates just how much matériel a war can consume.That includes more than 104 million rounds of small-arms ammunition, at least one million rounds of 155-millimeter artillery shells, 46,000 anti-tank weapons, more than 1,600 Stinger antiaircraft missiles and 8,500 Javelin anti-armor missiles, according to a Pentagon tally.The resupply challenge is not just a matter of money. 
1794	Military contractors have nearly stopped manufacturing Stingers — Raytheon’s last contract from the U.S. government was in 2002, Mr. Haynes said. 
1795	And while Javelins are still being made jointly by Raytheon and Lockheed — in September they were awarded a $311 million contract to deliver more of them — historically they have been able to make only about 2,100 a year, or about a quarter of what Ukraine has burned through since the outbreak of the war in February.In total, the Pentagon as of early December had awarded at least $6 billion to military contractors to resupply these and other items sent to Ukraine.
1796	“We’re going to ramp up,” Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said this month. 
1797	“We’ve really been working closely with industry to both increase their capacity and also the speed at which they’re able to produce.”The overall spending on national defense still remains relatively low as a percentage of the nation’s economy: about 3.2 percent of the gross domestic product this year, compared to 37 percent during World War II and 13 percent during the Korean War, according to Pentagon records.Still, companies are scrambling to avoid or resolve bottlenecks caused by the increase in demand.Lockheed, for example, spent more than $60 million of its own money in advance of getting Pentagon contract commitment to build more of its High Mobility Artillery Rocket System vehicles, or HIMARS, which fire guided rockets carrying 200 pounds of explosives that can hit targets nearly 50 miles away. 
1798	The vehicles have been much sought after by Ukraine, which has used them to devastating effect against the Russians.Traditionally, Lockheed has been able to build 60 of these trucks per year, but it is now shifting production to 24 hours a day and seven days a week in an effort to bring that annual total to 96 units. 
1799	It also now has a new $430 million contract to deliver more HIMARS, along with a new $521 million contract to build more of the rockets, called GMLRS, that these vehicles can fire.These resupply orders, while large in terms of many other contracts the federal government issues, are still relatively small for the biggest contractors. 
1800	At Lockheed, for example, about 70 percent of sales come from the U.S. government, and most of the rest from other governments worldwide. 
1801	Supply chain and labor shortage problems are cutting into sales and profits, including at Lockheed, which expects to see annual sales decline this year to $62.3 billion from $67 billion.
1802	“The clutch is engaging but into some lower gears initially,” James Taiclet, Lockheed’s chief executive, said in October, adding that higher sales might not show up for another year.But there are more of the big-ticket orders coming. 
1803	In the aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Switzerland and Germany have both moved in recent months to finalize orders for the F-35 fighter jets, collectively worth $16 billion. 
1804	Overall foreign military sales notifications to Congress so far in 2022 have totaled $81 billion, the third highest figure in the last 25 years, with an increasing share of these sales going to European and Asian nations.Next year’s military budget also includes major investments in new hypersonic weapons that are also being aggressively pursued by China. 
1805	Raytheon and Northrop Grumman in September won a $1 billion contract just to build prototypes for the Air Force.Other companies want to replace older equipment sent to Ukraine with newer models. 
1806	BAE, for example, intends to sell the Army more armored vehicles called AMPVs, in place of the more than 200 of BAE’s Vietnam-era M113 armored personnel carriers sent to Ukraine, which it no longer makes.
1807	“Nothing’s cheap, right?” said Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro  this month at the conference in California, as he ran through many new investments the Navy is making. 
1808	“Nothing’s free.”Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.
1809	On the morning of Jan. 6, 2021, as scores of Proud Boys were getting ready to take their place in a pro-Trump mob outside the Capitol, a leader of the far-right group sent a message to his colleagues.
1810	“I want to see thousands of normies burn that city to ash today,” he wrote.Almost two years later, the notion that the Proud Boys wanted to provoke violence among the “normies” — or the normal people — in the crowd that day rests at the heart of the government’s case against five members of the group who are facing trial on charges of seditious conspiracy in connection with the Capitol attack.At the trial, which begins with jury selection on Monday, prosecutors intend to argue that the five defendants turned the mob into a weapon on Jan. 6 and pointed it at the Capitol, where lawmakers had gathered to certify the results of the 2020 election, according to court papers and pretrial hearings. 
1811	It was all part of a plot, the government will say, to stop the lawful transfer of power and ensure that President Donald J. Trump remained in office.The Proud Boys trial is opening in Federal District Court in Washington less than a month after Stewart Rhodes, the leader of another far-right group, the Oath Keepers militia, was convicted along with one of his lieutenants of seditious conspiracy at a separate trial in the same courthouse, which sits within sight of the domed Capitol building.While prosecutors could have taken the five Proud Boys to trial on relatively simple charges like trespassing or interfering with law enforcement officers, they instead aimed higher and charged sedition, which carries a hefty 20-year maximum sentence and has much more serious political connotations. 
1812	But by doing so, the government has assumed the burden of proving that the defendants plotted in advance of Jan. 6 to use force to oppose the authority of the U.S. government or to interfere with the execution of federal laws — in this case, those that govern the transfer of presidential power.Much as in Mr. Rhodes’s trial, the government’s presentation in the Proud Boys trial will seek to bolster its sedition charges with thousands of internal text messages seized by the government and insider testimony from cooperating witnesses. 
1813	But the differences between the two proceedings may be more instructive than their similarities.For one thing, prosecutors never accused Mr. Rhodes and his four co-defendants of personally committing serious acts of violence at the Capitol. 
1814	Instead, they proved that the Oath Keepers plotted to use force against the government by pointing out that the group persistently said a civil war might be needed to fight the administration of Joseph R. Biden Jr. and that on Jan. 6 it stashed an arsenal of high-powered weapons in hotel rooms in Virginia.But in trying the Proud Boys, prosecutors plan to take a different tack: They will offer the jury a detailed account of how the five defendants — including Enrique Tarrio, the group’s former chairman — led their own troops and other “tools” in the mob into battle at the Capitol and played a central role in breaches of the building and in hand-to-hand fights with the police.Founded in 2016 during Mr. Trump’s first run for office, the Proud Boys have long described themselves as “Western chauvinists” out to protect American politics from the supposedly corrosive effects of modern liberal culture.But something else has always simmered beneath that public guise: a toxic stew of male grievance, misogyny, Islamophobia and anti-gay hatred, as well as a veneration of violence that has often boiled over into brawling in the streets.The government plans to tell some of that history at the trial and to demonstrate how the Proud Boys, under Mr. Tarrio’s leadership, became involved in pro-Trump rallies in Washington after the election. 
1815	At one of those events, on Dec. 12, 2020, Mr. Tarrio burned a Black Lives Matter banner that had been hanging at a local Black church; other members of the group clashed with leftist counterprotesters, resulting in a Proud Boys leader, Jeremy Bertino, getting stabbed.A lingering effect of that incident, prosecutors plan to argue, is that it turned the Proud Boys against the police after years of having troublingly close relationships with officers across the country. 
1816	The government wants to show the jury how the group became disillusioned with law enforcement to explain the events of Jan. 6, when members of the Proud Boys took the lead in assaulting the police.One week after the December rally, Mr. Trump posted a message on Twitter that announced another protest — which he said would be “wild” — in Washington on Jan. 6. 
1817	Prosecutors will try to show that the Proud Boys heard the message as a clarion call and sprang into action.Working with a group of his top lieutenants, prosecutors say, Mr. Tarrio put together a handpicked crew of “rally boys” who would take the lead in the Proud Boys’ efforts on Jan. 6. 
1818	The rank-and-file members of the group, Mr. Tarrio later said, would work in 10-man teams that day with medics and communications experts.Mr. 
1819	Tarrio was not at the Capitol on Jan. 6, having been kicked out of Washington by a local judge after he returned to the city two days earlier and was arrested over the banner-burning incident and for carrying two high-capacity firearm magazines.But prosecutors plan to argue to the jury that three of his co-defendants — Joseph Biggs of Ormond Beach, Fla.
1820	; Ethan Nordean of Auburn, Wash.
1821	; and Zachary Rehl of Philadelphia — took the lead on the ground that day. 
1822	A fourth co-defendant — Dominic Pezzola of Rochester, N.Y. — is best known for having broken one of the first windows at the Capitol with a stolen police riot shield.As part of the government’s case, jurors are also likely to hear from several former Proud Boys who have since pleaded guilty, including two from North Carolina: Mr. Bertino and Charles Donohoe. 
1823	The government may also seek to introduce evidence about a document called “1776 Returns” that was given to Mr. Tarrio by one of his girlfriends and detailed a plan to surveil and storm several government buildings around the Capitol on Jan. 6.Recent court filings suggest that the lawyers for the Proud Boys intend to mount a robust defense. 
1824	Echoing the lawyers in the Oath Keepers case, their central argument will be to claim that while the defendants breached the Capitol building, they did not plan the attack in any way that rose to the level of seditious conspiracy.Indeed, the lawyers have claimed in court papers that many of the government’s own witnesses have provided statements to prosecutors contradicting the assertion that the Proud Boys had any sort of plan to assault the Capitol. 
1825	The lawyers have also maintained that the F.B.I. had as many as eight informants in the group before Jan. 6 and that none of them reported back about an intent to storm the building, raising questions, as one lawyer wrote, about “whether a Proud Boy conspiracy plan” to commit sedition “ever existed or could have existed.”In a more general sense, the defense will seek to persuade the jury that the Proud Boys are not racist brawlers, as they are often portrayed by the media, but more like what the founder of the group, Gavin McInnes, has long described them as: a patriotic men’s drinking club. 
1826	At one point, the lawyers had thought they might call Mr. McInnes as a witness for the defense, but that remains unclear.Still, the jury is likely to get a glimpse of Proud Boys culture as the lawyers relate how dozens of members of the group descended on Washington to support Mr. Trump on Jan. 6, with some of the leaders moving into an Airbnb rental apartment near Chinatown.As evidence that the Proud Boys had no plan to attack the Capitol, the lawyers may tell the jurors how a musician friendly to the group — Michale Graves, the former lead singer for the punk band Misfits — was supposed to give a private concert at the rental apartment on the afternoon or evening of Jan. 6.The lawyers have also accused the government of threatening to bring charges against several other people the defense wants to call as witnesses at the trial.In court papers, the lawyers said they wanted to introduce testimony from Shannon Rusch, a former member of the Navy SEALs who marched with Mr. Biggs and Mr. Nordean toward the Capitol on Jan. 6, and Adrienna DiCioccio, a right-wing political organizer who was also at the building. 
1827	But they claim the government is still investigating both Mr. Rusch’s family and Ms. DiCioccio, and has effectively scared them away from taking the stand.The lawyers have raised similar claims about a veteran Washington police officer, Lt. Shane Lamond, who could tell the jury how Mr. Tarrio was in constant contact with him before and during Jan. 6. 
1828	But prosecutors have been investigating Lieutenant Lamond’s relationship with Mr. Tarrio for several months, and his lawyer has said he will most likely invoke his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination if called as a witness.
1829	Ukraine is bracing for the possibility that Russia will sharply escalate the war in a winter offensive as Moscow tries to turn the tide on the battlefield and limit political backlash at home, a senior adviser to President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Sunday.Despite suffering severe setbacks over the first 10 months of war, the Russian military is now laying plans for mass infantry attacks akin to the tactics employed by the Soviet Union during World War II, the adviser, Mykhailo Podolyak, said in written responses to questions.Mr. 
1830	Podolyak’s comments came as Ukraine’s top military and political leaders have been warning in a series of recent interviews that Russia is massing troops and armaments to launch a renewed ground offensive by spring that very likely would include a second attempt to seize Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital.Russia has already drafted and is training soldiers who might be deployed in mass infantry attacks, Mr. Podolyak said. 
1831	It is one of several possible threats that Ukraine faces from Russia over the winter months, he said, as officials in Kyiv see little sign that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is seeking an end to the war.
1832	“Russia’s political leadership clearly refuses to acknowledge the tactical defeats that already took place and grasps at any, even the most illusory, chances to change the situation in its favor,” Mr. Podolyak said.Ukrainian officials have said they base their assessments of Russia’s war aims on the findings of their military and foreign intelligence agencies and on consultations with allies.In his comments, Mr. Podolyak said that Ukraine was taking  the risk of a fresh Russian offensive seriously and emphasized that its allies should understand this, too. 
1833	As Western governments plan for future weapons transfers to Ukraine, he suggested, the equipment should match the future threats.
1834	“It is extremely important that our partners take these risks no less seriously,” he said. 
1835	“Russia is not interested in ending the war until it suffers a significant military defeat and is forced to focus on its own internal political transformation.”Ukraine’s supreme military commander, Gen. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, said in an interview with The Economist published last week that Ukraine was training and outfitting reserves to defend against a new Russian offensive that might come in January, February or March.
1836	“The Russians are preparing some 200,000 fresh troops,” he said. 
1837	“I have no doubt they will have another go at Kyiv.”The statements by senior Ukrainian officials appeared to be part of a coordinated campaign to guard against complacency among Ukraine’s allies as the Russian Army struggles on the battlefield. 
1838	Since launching its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February, Russia has fallen back in three major retreats — from the territory around Kyiv, in the northeastern Kharkiv region and, last month, in the southern region of Kherson.The warnings also appear to be an attempt to counter the Kremlin’s efforts to persuade Ukraine’s Western allies to pressure Kyiv into a negotiated settlement.In parallel with the fighting along the front lines, Russia has bombarded civilian infrastructure targets throughout the country, knocking out heating, water and electricity for millions of Ukrainians. 
1839	In his nightly address to Ukrainians on Saturday, Mr. Zelensky said that electricity had been restored to six million people who lost power after a salvo of missile strikes on Friday. 
1840	The mayor of Kyiv, Vitali Klitschko, said on Sunday that neighborhood heating systems damaged in the strikes had been fully restored.Military analysts say that this campaign is intended to demoralize Ukrainians and push the Ukrainian government into a cease-fire that might allow Russia time to regroup and rearm for future offensives.But analysts who rely on open-source intelligence have said it is difficult to know what is happening at Russian military training bases. 
1841	The Kremlin said in September that it would mobilize 300,000 additional soldiers, and that some are already deployed in Ukraine.Mr. 
1842	Podolyak said that the type of mass infantry warfare Moscow seems to be preparing for would not be effective against Ukraine’s increasingly modern arsenal of precision-guided weaponry and surveillance drones. 
1843	But he said that the Russian military leadership had bent to Kremlin demands for advances on the ground for domestic political reasons.Russian commanders, he said, “diligently maintain Putin’s illusion of the possibility of ‘victory,’ in order to, firstly, maintain Putin’s personal power, and secondly, to avoid harsh punishment for admitting loss.”In their most recent setback, Russia forces retreated last month from the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson but remain within artillery range on the opposite bank of the Dnipro River. 
1844	Through the day on Sunday, Russian forces fired artillery at Kherson, wounding three people, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, a deputy presidential chief of staff, said in a post on Telegram.In its morning update on the status of the battlefield on Sunday, the Ukrainian military said that it had repulsed 15 ground assaults on its positions over the past 24 hours and that multiple frontline towns and villages had been targeted by Russian artillery.Most of the attacks came in the Donbas area of eastern Ukraine, the only section of the front line where the Russian Army is regularly staging offensive attacks. 
1845	Along much of the rest of the crescent-shaped front line in southeastern Ukraine, Russian forces are in a defensive crouch, building fortifications along new lines after their retreats earlier in the fall.
1846	When Chris Licht told his boss, Stephen Colbert, the host of the CBS program “Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” in February that he had been offered the chief executive job at CNN, Mr. Colbert was blunt: “Definitely don’t go do that.”But for Mr. Licht, nothing less than democracy itself was at stake. 
1847	He argued he could make CNN a news channel that people trusted, as opposed to one that monetized partisan combat.
1848	“Oh, man, you used to be in news, remember?” 
1849	Mr. Colbert recalled telling him. 
1850	“You said this was so much nicer — 12 weeks off, good pay, laugh for an hour every night. Everyone is really nice; you can say anything you want, and nobody leaks it. It’s great.”“CNN would be lucky to get you,” Mr. Colbert continued. 
1851	“But you’re my friend, and I’m telling you not to go.”“This is a calling,” Mr. Licht countered.At which point Mr. Colbert stopped trying to dissuade him: “I can’t negotiate with a calling.”On Feb. 28, Mr. Licht was named CNN’s new chief executive. 
1852	Since then, he and Mr. Colbert have spoken nearly every Friday. 
1853	Each time, Mr. Colbert begins with the same four words:“I told you so.”By almost any measure, Mr. Licht, 51, has had a rough start. 
1854	His first major act was to kill the network’s fledgling streaming service, CNN+, and fire 400 or so people working on it. 
1855	CNN’s revenue and profits have plunged to a projected $750 million this year, down from $1.25 billion last year, partly from the costs associated with CNN+, the network acknowledged. 
1856	CNN’s ratings declined, on average, this year compared with 2021, according to Nielsen, with CNN falling behind MSNBC for the first time in prime time on election night among total viewers. 
1857	(CNN prevailed in the coveted 25-to-54 age group.)At the end of November, Mr. Licht levied another round of job cuts — this time just under 10 percent of CNN’s work force of about 4,000, which plunged morale further. 
1858	Among the casualties were familiar commentators like Chris Cillizza, key behind-the-scenes producers with decades of experience, and the entirety of HLN, CNN’s sister network, and its popular morning host, Robin Meade.A chorus of media pundits has pounced on every tidbit of bad news. 
1859	Mr. Licht’s early programming efforts aimed at repositioning the network as broader and less partisan have prompted howls of criticism, with former MSNBC host and former colleague Keith Olbermann publicly calling Mr. Licht a “TV Fascist” after he moved Don Lemon, a liberal host, from a prime-time slot to a revamped morning show.
1860	“The uninformed vitriol, especially from the left, has been stunning,” Mr. Licht said in one of several interviews with The New York Times spanning his nearly eight-month tenure. 
1861	“Which proves my point: so much of what passes for news is name-calling, half-truths and desperation.”Mr. 
1862	Licht said he was under no illusion that stepping into the chief executive job would be easy or make him popular. 
1863	The network’s previous parent, the telecommunications giant AT&T, had just spun off its Warner Media subsidiary, which included CNN, into a new company run by Discovery’s chief executive, David Zaslav.Just two months before the companies merged and only weeks before CNN+ was introduced to the world, the network’s popular and longtime chief executive, Jeff Zucker, was forced to resign after failing to disclose a romantic relationship with his top lieutenant, Allison Gollust. 
1864	Some at CNN felt Mr. Zucker had been unfairly sacrificed and remained staunchly loyal to their former boss.CNN had also become the poster child for the poisoned relationship between former President Donald J. Trump and mainstream media organizations. 
1865	Mr. Trump repeatedly branded CNN as “fake news,” and his administration engaged in open warfare with CNN correspondents like Jim Acosta, whom Mr. Trump once called “a rude, terrible person” during a news conference. 
1866	In 2018, CNN’s New York headquarters had to be evacuated after a bomb threat.CNN remained enviably profitable, earning over $1 billion a year for the past five years. 
1867	But cable news, along with all cable channels, has been in secular decline, troubled by shifting viewer habits in an era of cord cutting and an exodus to streaming services and online news sites.It’s not clear anyone could surmount those challenges, let alone someone who’d just spent nearly six years at a late-night entertainment show and had never managed a complex, globe-spanning organization with thousands of employees.So why even take the job?
1868	Mr. 
1869	Licht seemed to have TV news in his DNA. 
1870	As a child, he’d created a fictional TV news network, WBC, and produced his own newscast using a VCR camera in his basement in Newtown, Conn. 
1871	At about the age of 9, he met the NBC legal correspondent Carl Stern on a family vacation and, in Mr. Licht’s telling, “stuck to him like glue.” 
1872	Mr. Licht pried the newsman’s phone number from him and used it regularly. 
1873	“I was obsessed,” Mr. Licht said. 
1874	After college at Syracuse University, Mr. Licht landed jobs at NBC affiliates in Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
1875	As a reporter and producer, he covered a mass shooting in San Bernardino, the plane crash that killed John F. Kennedy Jr., two presidential campaigns and three Olympics.In 2005, he moved to NBC’s sibling network, MSNBC, soon becoming an executive producer for “Morning Joe,” which he helped develop into an improbable success in its hotly competitive morning time slot. 
1876	Notably, the two hosts, the former Republican politician Joe Scarborough and the more liberal former CBS correspondent Mika Brzezinski, straddled the political divide. 
1877	The tension between them seemed to enhance their audience appeal. 
1878	Mr. Licht encouraged them to be themselves and embrace the unexpected. 
1879	(They later married.)Mr. 
1880	Licht moved to CBS in 2010, where he’d scored another early morning success. 
1881	He lifted ratings at the perennial also-ran “CBS This Morning” on the strength of the program’s three hosts, Charlie Rose, Gayle King and Norah O’Donnell, and an emphasis on news and in-depth interviews, rather than the lighter fare format of its competitors “Today” and “Good Morning America.”After having a brain aneurysm in 2010 when he was still under 40, Mr. Licht wrote a book about what he learned from the experience, while still describing himself as a “killer TV producer” with “no urge to surrender my spot in the fast lane,” even after the near-fatal incident.Restless after six years at “This Morning,” in 2016 he joined the then-faltering CBS program “Late Show With Stephen Colbert.” 
1882	Within a year, Mr. Colbert had seized the late-night ratings crown from Jimmy Fallon of NBC’s “Tonight Show.”Soon after the Warner-Discovery deal was announced, Mr. Zaslav summoned Mr. Licht to Discovery’s headquarters in Manhattan on 19th Street and asked what he thought of CNN.Mr. 
1883	Licht told him he had no interest in running it. 
1884	“I got out of news, and I’m not going back,” Mr. Licht had insisted.Mr. 
1885	Zaslav ignored the demurral. 
1886	Over the next several weeks, he kept making the case to Mr. Licht. 
1887	In fact, Mr. Zaslav said in an interview that he never considered anyone else for the job.The two men have known each other for 15 years, since both were working at NBC, where Mr. Zaslav helped start MSNBC. 
1888	In the years since, they have had breakfast once a quarter. 
1889	Mr. Licht has looked to Mr. Zaslav as a mentor, and Mr. Zaslav has admired Mr. Licht’s work ethic and drive.
1890	“He’s a fighter, and he likes to win,” Mr. Zaslav said.At their first meeting, Mr. Zaslav argued that running CNN would be “a great opportunity to build the No. 1 news brand in the world,” and “the most trusted brand in news where people go every day and in a crisis for the best version of the truth.”And more than that: “This is important for America. It’s important for a functioning society.”Mr. 
1891	Licht and Mr. Zaslav — not to mention Warner’s largest shareholder, the media mogul John Malone — were philosophically aligned. 
1892	Fox and MSNBC were “advocacy” networks, as Mr. Zaslav put it, a proven business model appealing to like-minded viewers but of scant, if any, value as a public service. 
1893	Whether by design or happenstance, he believed CNN had tacked left, a pale version of MSNBC that nonetheless alienated wide parts of the American electorate with a focus on politics and the president at the time, Mr. Trump.Ted Turner’s mantra had always been “the news is the star.” 
1894	Mr. Trump “is not the star,” Mr. Zaslav said.Yet Mr. Licht was noncommittal. 
1895	On a subsequent phone call, Mr. Zaslav urged Mr. Licht to think about CNN and whether he’d be interested in the top job. 
1896	After Mr. Licht hung up, his wife, Jennifer Blanco Licht, a former TV executive herself, asked: “Is this crazy? I think you should do it.”The two men continued the conversation on a long walk in Central Park. 
1897	(They both live near the park.) 
1898	During that conversation, Mr. Zaslav warned Mr. Licht that he’d be closely scrutinized and judged harshly. 
1899	Is your family ready for this? 
1900	Are you ready for this? 
1901	Because “it will be brutal,” Mr. Zaslav said.Mr. 
1902	Licht said he doesn’t recall Mr. Zaslav ever offering him the job, or his accepting it. 
1903	At one point, Mr. Zaslav simply asked, “Who’s your lawyer?” and started acting like Mr. Licht was CNN’s future chief executive. 
1904	A contract ensued.On their first lunch afterward, at Mr. Zaslav’s usual corner table at Gramercy Tavern, Mr. Zaslav indicated their yearslong relationship had fundamentally changed. 
1905	“We’ve been friends for 15 years,” Mr. Zaslav said. 
1906	“We’re not friends any more. You work for me.”Almost immediately, their shared vision of saving democracy ran into the harsh reality of cable news economics.With Fox News and MSNBC having already staked out the right and left ends of the political spectrum, attracting the middle (what Mr. Licht referred to as “normal” people) has proved elusive. 
1907	Mr. Zaslav had stressed that he didn’t care — at least not much — about CNN’s current ratings, revenue or profitability. 
1908	He recognized that it would take years to reposition and rebuild the network. 
1909	But even he had his limits.AT&T’s board had approved an ambitious budget of $350 million for CNN+, much of it already spent by the time Mr. Licht arrived. 
1910	Many more millions would be needed. 
1911	With Warner facing pressure from Wall Street to find $3 billion in savings, on April 21, Mr. Licht killed the streaming service after less than a month on air.In an effort to restore morale and calm anxiety, Mr. Licht assured CNN employees at a network-wide town hall meeting on May 5 that Warner Bros. 
1912	Discovery didn’t anticipate further job cuts at CNN because there was no overlap between the news network and Discovery’s cable channels, and thus there wasn’t anyone else doing the same jobs that would need to be cut. 
1913	In a series of additional town hall meetings, most of them leaked almost immediately to The New York Times and other news outlets, Mr. Licht also laid the groundwork for the network’s shift to broader, less political and less partisan coverage. 
1914	This was not, he stressed repeatedly, a move to the “center,” a boring, political neutral zone that Mr. Licht wasn’t even sure existed. 
1915	Rather, it was an attempt to explore controversial issues from varied perspectives — not to tell people “what to think,” as he put it, but “how to think,” or what he called a “blueprint for how to make decisions.”In July, Mr. Licht made a highly symbolic pilgrimage to Capitol Hill noteworthy for its inclusion of Republicans like the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, and Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas. 
1916	Although he spent equal time with Democratic leaders like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Mr. Licht was irritated that his visit was billed as an “apology tour” and effort to coax Republicans back onto the network — part of CNN’s perceived move to the right.After long absences, several Republicans have since appeared on CNN, including Mr. McCarthy and Senator Rick Scott of Florida.Featuring hosts and guests with opposing points of view and playing up controversy has paid ratings dividends on cable in the past, notably on CNN’s own “Crossfire,” which came under criticism for evolving into to a verbal food fight criticized by the comedian Jon Stewart as “hurting America.”But Mr. Licht said he wasn’t interested in controversy for its own sake, but to offer a “rational conversation about polarizing issues.” 
1917	After watching CNN, he hopes people will “take what they’ve heard to the dinner table and have a discussion,” he said. 
1918	“That’s a dream of mine.”Two examples have been coverage of the abortion debate in the wake of the Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade, and the debate over gun rights. 
1919	To vocal criticism from the left, he hired Stephen Gutowski, founder and editor of The Reload, a firearms website. 
1920	No one wants a school shooting, said Mr. Licht, whose hometown, Newtown, was the site of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre. 
1921	“But we have to understand the culture of people who like guns,” he said.
1922	“This is not vanilla, centrist or boring,” he added.Mr. 
1923	Licht has barely begun to put his stamp on the network’s programming, but it’s already evident in the new morning show, “CNN This Morning.” 
1924	Mr. Licht picked the hosts, persuading the left-leaning Don Lemon to trade his prime-time slot for early morning, and pairing him with the former Daily Caller reporter and CNN White House correspondent Kaitlan Collins and Poppy Harlow, a former host of “CNN Newsroom.” 
1925	The show takes a somewhat similar approach to the one he used at “CBS This Morning” (which also shares a near-identical name).
1926	In a series of interviews with The Times, Mr. Licht visibly came to life talking about “This Morning” and its co-hosts. 
1927	“They obviously like each other,” he said. 
1928	“The chemistry is great. I love the collaboration. Every day, it evolves. It’s not like me giving orders. It’s so much fun.”“This Morning” debuted on Nov. 1. 
1929	The New York Post (which shares ownership with CNN’s rival, Fox News) reported the next day that “‘CNN This Morning’ bombs in debut,” drawing just 387,000 viewers, far behind rival morning shows and trailing its predecessor on CNN, “New Day.” 
1930	CNN called the instant critique “absurd and cheap” after just one day’s data. 
1931	(Since then, the show has gained slightly among total viewers.) 
1932	More significantly, Mr. Licht noted, “This Morning” has broken news, including the chief Washington correspondent Jake Tapper’s scoop that Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona was leaving the Democratic Party to become an Independent.Prime time looms as an even greater challenge. 
1933	In August, Mr. Licht moved Mr. Tapper from his 4 p.m. anchor position to the coveted 9 p.m. slot that had been vacated by Chris Cuomo after CNN fired him for what it deemed inappropriate efforts to help his brother, New York’s former governor, Andrew Cuomo, fend off the sexual harassment allegations that led to his resignation from office. 
1934	The experiment with Mr. Tapper fared poorly in the ratings and lasted just one month.Mr. 
1935	Licht acknowledged that prime time remains an “open canvas.” 
1936	He said he and his colleagues were meeting and “throwing things against the wall, looking at off-the-beaten path opportunities.” 
1937	Among the names tossed out have been entertainment, comedy and sports figures. 
1938	He declined to be more specific but promised surprises.Miklos Sarvary, a professor and director of the media and technology program at Columbia Business School, said that entertainment was potentially more profitable than low-margin news. 
1939	“But what does that do to the brand if you want to be the most trusted name in news?” he said. 
1940	“News is supposed to be serious. I’m not sure that putting on a comedian is a great move for credibility.”Mr. 
1941	Licht said he understood Mr. Sarvary’s point, but said prime time offered “some leeway for being a little different.”“It has to be compelling and entertaining without hurting the news brand,” he said, citing his former boss Mr. Colbert, and Mr. Stewart as “the kind of people who’d work,” while acknowledging that Mr. Stewart is already locked into a lucrative contract at Apple TV.Every Saturday, Mr. Licht sends Mr. Zaslav a memo with highlights of the week and programming and financial updates. 
1942	Mr. Licht’s growth strategy is focused on CNN.com, which attracts more than 200 million unique visitors each month, according to CNN. 
1943	But at its peak, CNN digital generated only about 10 percent of the network’s profits, Mr. Licht confirmed.On Oct. 13, Mr. Licht made his debut in front of Warner Brother Discovery’s board at a hotel in Los Angeles, where he outlined both his growth and content strategy. 
1944	Asked about his efforts to make CNN less partisan, Mr. Licht gave this analogy: Suppose it’s raining outside. 
1945	CNN plans to have people on who love the rain, and it will have people on who say they don’t like the rain. 
1946	But it won’t have anyone on who says it’s sunny out.Mr. 
1947	Licht said he used the analogy to make clear that a less-partisan CNN did not mean it was any less committed to truth. 
1948	“This wasn’t to plot a new course but to assure people we would not let up one inch in being truth tellers,” he said. 
1949	“The change is we will not do Trump 24/7 or let him dictate our agenda.”By all accounts, Mr. Licht’s presentation was warmly received by directors, including Mr. Malone.Mr. 
1950	Licht’s vision is contending with industrywide pressures to cut costs. 
1951	(He said he appreciates but doesn’t really believe Mr. Zaslav’s professed indifference to financial results.) 
1952	By announcing the need for more layoffs on Oct. 26, he said he hoped to engage in a “transparent” process that would leave everyone feeling they’d been heard. 
1953	But, he said, “it would be irresponsible not to do the tough work now.” 
1954	He added, “I promise you CNN will be more profitable next year.”However transparent, many in CNN’s rank and file felt blindsided by the cuts, especially after what they perceived as his earlier reassurances that no further layoffs would be needed. 
1955	In a all-staff meeting in November, Mr. Licht said he stood by his earlier remark that there would be no merger-related layoffs, and “I absolutely would not have said something that I did not believe to be true.” 
1956	But he said he understood how his remarks had hurt his credibility. 
1957	“I have to win that credibility back,” he acknowledged.Mr. 
1958	Licht said the firings were the “low point” of his tenure so far.At another all-staff meeting this month, aimed at restoring morale, Mr. Licht took questions and then ended with a passage he wrote himself:In terms of morale, let me just say, you work at a world-renowned news organization alongside the best journalists on the globe. 
1959	Your jobs have meaning. 
1960	Your jobs have an impact. 
1961	You are part of something bigger, of something with tremendous meaning. 
1962	And nothing about that has changed. 
1963	And you have in me as a leader, who has done a lot of your jobs, someone who has your back every step of the way. 
1964	My loyalty is first and foremost to this organization and to journalism without fear or favor to anyone else, including our parent company.That’s why I’m here. 
1965	That’s why I took this job.
1966	“I want CNN to be essential to society,” Mr. Licht said in one of our interviews. 
1967	“If you’re essential then the revenue will follow.”And if it doesn’t?
1968	“Maybe it won’t work,” Mr. Licht conceded. 
1969	“But I’d rather try to win this way.”Benjamin Mullin and Michael M. Grynbaum contributed reporting.
1970	After three pandemic-battered years at the box office, Hollywood desperately wanted “Avatar: The Way of Water,” the sequel to the top-grossing film on record, to arrive like a ticket-selling tsunami. 
1971	Surveys that track audience interest suggested that “The Way of Water” could arrive to as much as $175 million in opening-weekend ticket sales in the United States and Canada.It was not to be.The ultraexpensive event movie collected about $134 million at North American theaters over its first three days, according to Comscore, which compiles ticketing data. 
1972	Directed by James Cameron and revisiting the fantasy world of Pandora, “The Way of Water” cost Disney an estimated $600 million to make and market. 
1973	Three more sequels are planned.But there may still be a way for “The Way of Water” to become a big, blue juggernaut — possibly even surpassing the $2 billion in global sales that Cameron publicly set as the benchmark for financial success, given the film’s stratospheric production and marketing costs. 
1974	Consider what happened with the first “Avatar” in 2009. 
1975	It arrived to a soft $77 million and went on to gross $2.9 billion worldwide.
1976	“It’s not the kind of movie that you can analyze by looking at how the first weekend did,” said Richard L. Gelfond, the chief executive of IMAX Corporation. 
1977	“It’s all about how it holds on. I think the legs are going to be really strong.”IMAX is planning to play “The Way of Water” until the end of January, in part because there is very little competition until then. 
1978	Studios typically flood theaters with spectacles at this time of year because the holidays leave so many people with time on their hands. 
1979	But multiple event movies were pushed into 2023 because of pandemic-related slowdowns in production.AMC Entertainment, the world’s No. 1 multiplex operator, has more than 100,000 showtimes and 10 million seats on sale for “The Way of Water” through New Year’s Day in the United States alone.
1980	“The Way of Water” also arrived in cinemas in almost every international market over the weekend, collecting an additional $300.5 million, for a healthy global opening total of $434.5 million, according to Disney. 
1981	It was the second-highest global opening for the year, behind “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.”The top international market for “The Way of Water” was China, where the movie arrived to $57.1 million in ticket sales, despite restrictions on theater capacity in some major cities because of coronavirus outbreaks. 
1982	Also in China, IMAX delivered its biggest opening weekend marketing share ever, accounting for 27 percent of the box office in the country on only 1 percent of total screens.In North America, an unusually large percentage of ticket sales for “The Way of Water” came from IMAX theaters and other premium-format locations, including those with 3-D presentation. 
1983	Those venues accounted for 62 percent of the film’s domestic total, according to Disney. 
1984	Some people may have had a difficult time finding tickets to such screenings — sellouts were common — and decided to wait, box office analysts said.
1985	“The Way of Water,” an ecological parable that is a hybrid of live-action footage and specialized animation, has a marathon run time of three hours and 12 minutes, which may have been too much of a commitment for some people on the weekend before Christmas. 
1986	But most box office analysts do not see length as a problem for “The Way of Water” in the long run, in part because reviews have been quite positive. 
1987	Ticket buyers gave the movie an A grade in CinemaScore exit polls.
1988	(The first “Avatar” was two hours and 42 minutes long. “The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,” with a run time of three hours and 29 minutes, holds the length record for a no-intermission, wide-release film, according to Comscore.)“Expectations aside, this is an outstanding opening,” said David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter on box office numbers, noting that “The Way of Water” arrived to stronger ticket sales than most superhero sequels. 
1989	“The movie is set up for a very strong run,” he added.
1990	Funding Will Advance Electrolysis Technology, Drive Down Clean Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Costs, Provide Long-term Support for Hydrogen Hubs and Other Industry DeploymentsThe Biden-Harris Administration, through the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), announced its intent to issue $750 million in funding from President Biden’s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to dramatically reduce the cost of clean-hydrogen technologies. 
1991	The funding is a crucial component of the Administration’s comprehensive approach to accelerating the widespread use of clean hydrogen and will play a vital role in supporting commercial-scale hydrogen deployment. 
1992	Produced with net-zero carbon emissions, clean hydrogen is a key pillar in the emerging clean energy economy and will be essential for achieving the President’s goal of a 100% clean electrical grid by 2035 and net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. 
1993	“Today’s announcement is yet another exciting step toward lowering the cost of and scaling-up clean hydrogen production, a versatile fuel essential to the nation’s historic transition to an equitable and secure clean energy future,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. 
1994	“By investing in the cutting-edge research and development necessary to making market-ready clean hydrogen a reality, DOE is delivering on President Biden’s promise to implement an ambitious climate agenda.” 
1995	See related article: Biden-Harris Administration Announces $3.7 Billion to Kick-Start America’s Carbon Removal IndustryClean hydrogen—which is produced with zero or next-to-zero emissions from renewables, nuclear energy, or natural gas with carbon sequestration—is set to play a vital future role in reducing emissions from some of the hardest-to-decarbonize sectors of our economy, including industrial and chemical processes and heavy-duty transportation. 
1996	Clean hydrogen can also support the expansion of renewable power by providing a means for long-duration energy storage and offers flexibility and multiple revenue streams to all types of clean power generation—including today’s nuclear fleet, advanced nuclear, and other innovative technologies. 
1997	By enabling diverse, domestic clean-energy pathways across multiple sectors of the economy, hydrogen will strengthen American energy independence, resiliency, and security. 
1998	While hydrogen technologies have come a long way over the last several years, costs and other challenges to at-scale adoption need to be addressed for clean hydrogen to realize its full potential. 
1999	Together with the regional clean hydrogen hubs (H2Hubs), tax incentives in the President’s Inflation Reduction Act, and ongoing research, development, and demonstration in the DOE Hydrogen Program, these investments will accelerate the technical advances and scale-up needed to achieve DOE’s Hydrogen Shot goal of $1 per kilogram of clean hydrogen within a decade. 
2000	Managed by DOE’s Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technologies Office (HFTO), projects funded through this opportunity will address underlying technical barriers to cost reduction that can’t be overcome by scale alone and ensure emerging commercial-scale deployments will be viable with future lower-cost, higher-performing technology. 
2001	Reaching cost reduction goals will open new markets for clean hydrogen—creating more clean energy jobs, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and strengthening America’s competitiveness in the global clean energy market. 
2002	By enabling a sustainable clean-hydrogen economy, these investments will help reduce harmful air pollution and decarbonize some of the economy’s most polluting sectors—including chemical and industrial processes and heavy transportation. 
2003	Reducing emissions in these sectors will be especially beneficial for disadvantaged communities that have suffered disproportionately from local air pollution in the past. 
2004	Additionally, DOE’s National Clean Hydrogen Strategy and Roadmap and President Biden’s Justice40 Initiative serve as important pillars driving the energy justice efforts by HFTO and the Hydrogen Program.
2005	Respect for the planet is one of Toyota Motor North America’s (TMNA) core values.

2023	On Saturday night, Parliament and Council reached a provisional agreement to set up a new fund to help vulnerable citizens most affected by energy and transport poverty.Negotiators agreed to establish the Social Climate Fund (SCF) to benefit vulnerable households, micro-enterprises and transport users that are particularly affected by energy and transport poverty. 
2024	Only measures and investments that respect the principle of ‘do no significant harm’ and aim to reduce fossil fuel dependency will receive support.Focus on tackling energy and transport povertyEU countries will have to submit “Social Climate Plans”, after consulting with local and regional authorities, economic and social partners as well as civil society, which will cover two types of initiatives.Firstly, the Fund will finance temporary direct income support measures to tackle the increase in road transport and heating fuel prices – with a limit of up to 37.5% of the total estimated cost of each national plan. 
2025	It will also cover long-lasting structural investments, including buildings renovation, decarbonisation solutions and integration of renewable energy, purchasing and infrastructure for zero- and low-emission vehicles, as well as the use of public transport and shared mobility services.See related article: EU Commission and EBRD to Unlock €2.1 Billion for Sustainable Infrastructure and Green EconomyTimeline and financingAt Parliament’s request, the SCF will start in 2026, one year before the Emissions Trading System (ETS) is extended to cover buildings and road transport (the so-called “ETS II”). 
2026	If energy prices are exceptionally high, the ETS extension may be postponed by one year.In the beginning, the fund will be financed through the revenues obtained from auctioning 50 million ETS allowances (estimated at around €4 billion). 
2027	Once the ETS extension enters into force, the SCF will be funded from auctioning ETS II allowances up to an amount of €65 billion, with an additional 25% covered by national resources (amounting to an estimated total of €86,7 billion).
2028	An online press conference with EP negotiations on the outcome of the ETS and SCF provisional agreements will take place on Monday, 19 December 2022, at 10.30 CET.QuotesCo-rapporteur Esther de LANGE (EPP, NL) said: “With this agreement we aim to ensure a fair energy transition for everyone. The Social Climate Fund will help vulnerable households in the energy transition, for instance with insulation vouchers or moving towards greener transport options. For Parliament, it was important that the fund would not be a blank cheque for member states. I am very happy we managed to ensure that the money will reach the most vulnerable under the right conditions.”Co-rapporteur David CASA (EPP, MT) said: “With this agreement on the Social Climate Fund, we are the closest we have ever been to ensuring that the climate transition will be fairer and more socially inclusive. In the pipeline are billions available to member states to invest in the energy needs of millions of households and small businesses. This is positive for our energy needs, for the climate, and for our citizens.”
2029	On Saturday night, MEPs and EU governments agreed to reform the Emissions Trading System to further reduce industrial emissions and invest more in climate friendly technologies.The EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), which enshrines the “polluter pays” principle, is at the core of European climate policy and key to achieving the objective of EU climate-neutrality. 
2030	By putting a price on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the ETS has triggered significant reductions in EU emissions, as industries have an incentive to reduce their emissions and invest in climate friendly technologies.Increased ambitions for 2030Emissions in the ETS sectors must be cut by 62% by 2030, compared to 2005, which is one percentage point more than proposed by the Commission. 
2031	In order to reach this reduction, there will be a one-off reduction to the EU-wide quantity of allowances of 90 Mt Co2 equivalents in 2024 and 27 Mt in 2026 in combination with an annual reduction of allowances by 4.3% from 2024-27 and 4.4% from 2028-30.Phasing out free allowances to companiesThe free allowances to industries in the ETS will be phased out as follows:2026: 2.5%, 2027: 5%, 2028: 10%, 2029: 22.5%, 2030: 48.5%, 2031: 61%, 2032: 73.5%, 2033: 86%, 2034: 100%.
2032	The Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), on which MEPs reached an agreement with EU governments earlier this week to prevent carbon leakage, will be phased in at the same speed that the free allowances in the ETS will be phased out. 
2033	The CBAM will therefore start in 2026 and be fully phased in by 2034.By 2025, the Commission shall assess the risk of carbon leakage for goods produced in the EU intended for export to non-EU countries and, if needed, present a WTO-compliant legislative proposal to address this risk. 
2034	In addition, an estimated 47.5 million allowances will be used to raise new and additional financing to address any risk of export-related carbon leakage.An ETS II for buildings and transportA separate new ETS II for fuel for road transport and buildings that will put a price on emissions from these sectors will be established by 2027. 
2035	This is one year later than proposed by the Commission. 
2036	As requested by Parliament, fuel for other sectors such as manufacturing will also be covered. 
2037	In addition, ETS II could be postponed until 2028 to protect citizens, if energy prices are exceptionally high. 
2038	Furthermore, a new price stability mechanism will be set-up to ensure that if the price of an allowance in ETS II rises above 45 EUR, 20 million additional allowances will be released.See related article: EU Commission and EBRD to Unlock €2.1 Billion for Sustainable Infrastructure and Green EconomyFinancing the green transitionMore money will be made available for innovative technologies and to modernise the energy system.The Innovation Fund, will be increased from the current 450 to 575 million allowances.The Modernisation Fund will be increased by auctioning an additional 2.5% of allowances that will support EU countries with GDP per capita below 75% of the EU average.All national revenues from auctioning ETS allowances shall be spent on climate related activities.MEPs and Council also agreed to establish a Social Climate Fund for the most vulnerable.Inclusion of emissions from shippingAs requested several times by Parliament, the ETS will, for the first time, be extended to maritime transport.Market Stability Reserve 24% of all ETS allowances will be placed in the market stability reserve to address possible imbalances between the supply of and demand for allowances in the market due to external shocks such as those caused by COVID-19.WasteEU countries must measure, report, and verify emissions from municipal waste incineration installations from 2024. 
2039	By 31 January 2026, the Commission shall present a report with the aim of including such installations in the EU ETS from 2028 with a possible opt-out until 2030 at the latest.QuoteAfter the deal, rapporteur Peter Liese (EPP, DE), said: “This deal will provide a huge contribution towards fighting climate change at low costs. It will give breathing space for citizens and industry in difficult times and provide a clear signal to European industry that it pays off to invest in green technologies.”
2040	Knorr-Bremse AG is systematically driving its ESG efforts and, with the support of Deutsche Bank, is linking its existing Supply Chain Finance program (SCF) to ESG ratings of suppliers. 
2041	By providing financial incentives to promote increased sustainability among its suppliers, Knorr-Bremse is taking another decisive step towards creating more sustainable value chains.For 15 years now, suppliers of Knorr-Bremse have benefited from the Supply Chain Finance program run by Deutsche Bank. 
2042	For example, they get their money sooner because the bank pre-finances at attractive interest rates until Knorr-Bremse pays the invoice. 
2043	The financing costs for the suppliers are based on the creditworthiness of Knorr-Bremse, which usually reduces the financing costs for the suppliers.Adding sustainability components to the program increases these financial benefits for the suppliers; those who operate more sustainably are rewarded with even better financial terms. 
2044	In this way, the global program will gradually encourage more and more suppliers to improve their ESG measures.Frank Markus Weber, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Board Spokesman of Knorr-Bremse AG: “Our Supplier Early Payment Program is becoming more sustainable: With our Syndicated Loan and our Sustainability Linked Bond, we have already shown how financing instruments and sustainability can be combined in a meaningful way.See related article: Deutsche Post DHL Group Introduces Sustainability-Linked Finance FrameworkThe Sustainability Linked Supply Chain Finance Program, implemented in collaboration with Deutsche Bank, is now the third financing instrument with which we at Knorr-Bremse are specifically promoting sustainability. The financial benefits arising from the latest program make an ESG rating particularly attractive for suppliers, creating a win-win situation for both sides: for our suppliers and for us as Knorr-Bremse.”Jan-Philipp Gillmann, Head of Corporate Bank EMEA, Deutsche Bank: “Sustainability-linked Supply Chain Finance programs enable our clients to create an incentive for their suppliers to be more sustainable. By improving their ESG rating, suppliers can further reduce financing costs together with their clients.”Suppliers in the Sustainability-linked Supply Chain Finance program (SSCF) can choose between two ESG rating providers: Ecovadis and NQC. 
2045	Thus, the program provides more flexibility compared to similar offerings. 
2046	This is NQC’s debut in an SSCF program. 
2047	NQC’s supplier assurance platform is used by many global automobile brands to assess their suppliers.
2048	On October 18th, one of the industry leaders in carrier-neutral hyperscale data center solutions, Chindata Group (“Chindata” or “the Group”) (Nasdaq: CD), released its third annual Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) Report (the “ESG Report”). 
2049	The 2021 Chindata ESG Report includes details about the company’s approach towards carbon neutrality under the “DATA” strategy and outlines the Chindata’s mission of supporting a better life with sustainable data storage facilities.Detailed within the ESG Report is the company’s “DATA” strategy, which stands for zero-carbon-first, environmental sustainability, tech-driven, and maintaining a willingness to take the lead. 
2050	Chindata notes the underlying thinking and processes involved in developing the newest generation of green data centers, relying on the Power Usage Effectiveness (the “PUE”) metric as a core indicator of the “greenness” of the centers. 
2051	According to a 2021 data survey released by a global authoritative data center standard organization, Uptime Institute, the average PUE of global hyperscale data centers is 1.57. 
2052	For Chindata, the annual average operating PUE over the last three years was 1.21, 1.22, and 1.21, respectively, markedly lower than the industry average.See related article: Expedia Group Launches New Global Social Impact & Sustainability Strategy“Chindata is the first in the industry to propose a 100% renewable energy target and a carbon neutral roadmap, focusing on green site selection, green construction, green operation, and a zero-carbon strategy,” said Wu Huapeng, CEO of Chindata. 
2053	“We will strive to adhere to the green and sustainable targets we have set for ourselves and contribute to the national strategy of carbon neutrality to realize the net emission goals set out in the Paris Agreement and support a better future.”The 100% renewable target was first set by Chindata in early 2019 and Chindata became the first Chinese tech company to make the pledge. 
2054	Since then, Chindata refined the roadmap in 2020 with the aim of ensuring by 2030, and 100% of its new hyperscale data centers in China would be powered by renewables. 
2055	In 2021, the Group set a new target to expand the 100% renewable energy-powered data centers to the rest of the world by 2040, including data centers in emerging markets such as Malaysia, India, and Thailand.From a technical standpoint, Chindata has invested immense resources in developing green and efficient solutions across the entire life cycle of a data center, throughout site selection, construction, and operations. 
2056	The Group has also produced a number of leading carbon-friendly innovations, including the modularization of key buildings and components, as evidenced by the MY06 project in Johor, Malaysia, in which manufacturing and construction was completed off-site and transported for installation. 
2057	This method not only lessens the impact on the surrounding environment due to minimal construction, but also greatly reduces the length of time of construction, providing further benefits to the Group. 
2058	By the end of 2021, Chindata was in possession of and had applied for a total of 280 patents, the number of which has been steadily increasing over the past three years and places the Group in a leading position in the industry.As outlined in the ESG Report and evidenced by the Group’s commitment to carbon-neutral development, Chindata attaches great importance to sustainability and ESG. 
2059	Recognizing values of stability and compliance, the Group has established a “five-in-one governance system”of corporate governance, operations, internal controls, effective risk management, business ethics, and supply chain management, forming a solid foundation for long-term and ethical development.Source: PRNewswire

2081	Franklin Templeton offers 59 ETFs to U.S. investors totaling approximately $10 billion in assets under managementFranklin Templeton announced the launch of the ClearBridge Sustainable Infrastructure Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF), expanding the firm’s U.S.-based ETF offerings. 
2082	Using the ticker symbol INFR, the fund is now listed on NASDAQ. 
2083	ClearBridge Investments is a specialist investment manager of Franklin Templeton.
2084	“Investors are looking at 2023 with a base case of slowing growth and possible recession, yet infrastructure assets are positioned to benefit from many macroeconomic drivers over the next year and beyond,” said Nick Langley, Portfolio Manager for the ClearBridge Sustainable Infrastructure ETF. 
2085	“Because of the many tailwinds for the asset class – the heightened focus on energy security in Europe, a supportive policy environment in the U.S. and the global push toward decarbonization of the global economy – it is a fantastic time for investors to diversify their portfolios with exposure to infrastructure.”The new ETF will seek to invest in income-generating infrastructure assets with strong environmental, social and governance attributes and stable cash flows. 
2086	The fund may invest in the physical assets necessary for communities and economies to function and grow, including transportation, electricity, energy infrastructure, water, sewage, communications and renewables.See related article: Franklin Templeton Launches Responsibly Sourced Gold ETF (FGLD)“The added benefits of investing in listed infrastructure are that it acts as a hedge against inflation and provides portfolio diversification, given its low correlations to equity and debt markets,” noted Langley.Franklin Templeton’s U.S. ETF platform provides solutions for a range of market conditions and investment objectives through active, smart beta and passively managed ETFs. 
2087	With the addition of INFR to its U.S. lineup, the firm now offers 59 ETFs with combined assets under management (AUM) of approximately $10 billion.
2088	“We continue to expand our product offerings across asset classes and strategies to meet the growing and evolving needs of our clients,” said Patrick O’Connor, Head of Global ETFs for Franklin Templeton. 
2089	“We are excited to offer this strategy from ClearBridge’s experienced infrastructure team within the attractive ETF wrapper.”
2090	Lawmakers at the European Parliament and members of the EU Council reached an agreement over the weekend on significant revisions to the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) – the EU’s internal cap and trade carbon pricing mechanism – including increasing the system’s targeted emissions reduction goals, and expanding the system to additional sectors.The agreement is a major step towards the completion of negotiations for the European Commission’s “Fit for 55” roadmap – the EU’s proposed strategy to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 55% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels – by finalizing the details on the EU’s most significant emissions reduction mechanism, covering around 40% of the EU’s total emissions.Executive Vice-President for the European Green Deal, Frans Timmermans, said:“Emissions trading is the centrepiece of our European Green Deal – putting a price on carbon. A stronger Emissions Trading System will help us drive investment into decarbonisation and reduce emissions further and faster, in line with our climate targets.”Established in 2005, the European Emission Trading System puts a price on carbon emissions for key greenhouse gas (GHG) intensive sectors, including electricity and heat generation, oil refineries, steel, cement, paper, chemicals, and commercial aviation, among others. 
2091	The system works on a cap and trade basis, setting a cap limiting the amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) that can be emitted by companies each year, and a fixed number of carbon emissions allowances are issued annually, with companies required to hold enough allowances to cover their emissions and ensure they fall under the cap, and able to trade allowances with one another as needed.According to the European Commission, the revenues from the EU ETS are to be spent by member states entirely on climate and energy-related projects as well as on addressing social aspects of the transition.The new agreement will see a substantial increase in the EU ETS’ ambition, directing emissions reductions in the covered sectors to 62% by 2030 compared to 2005, relative to the prior 43% mandate. 
2092	The pace of emissions reductions will increase as well, to 4.3% from 2024 – 2027 and 4.4% from 2028 – 2030. 
2093	In addition, current free allowances under the EU ETS will be phased out over the next several years, following the recent agreement to implement a carbon tax on imports (the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)), enabling the tax to comply with WTO rules.The agreement also brings emissions trading to new sectors, with the EU ETS expanding to cover shipping emissions from the maritime sector, and the establishment of a separate emissions trading system for the buildings and road transport and some other industrial sectors beginning in 2027.Alongside the EU ETS deal, the agreement also includes the creation of a new Social Climate fund, financed by €65 billion from the EU budget, plus 25% co-financing by member states, aimed at providing financial support to vulnerable households and micro-enterprises to cope with the price impacts of an ETS for the buildings and road transport and fuels sectors. 
2094	The fund will provide investments in energy efficiency measures such as home insulation, heat pumps, solar panels, and electric mobility, as well as providing direct income.Marian Jurečka Czech Minister for Environment, said:“The agreement on the EU Emissions Trading System and the Social Climate Fund is a victory for the climate and for European climate policy. This will allow us to meet climate objectives within the main sectors of the economy, while making sure the most vulnerable citizens and micro-enterprises are effectively supported in the climate transition.”
2095	The UK government announced that Virgin Atlantic has won a competition to receive funding to operate the first-ever “net zero transatlantic flight,” flying from London to New York on 100% sustainable aviation fuel, planned for 2023.Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) is seen as one of the key tools to help decarbonize the aviation industry, which currently accounts for 2-3% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. 
2096	SAF is generally produced from sustainable resources, like waste oils and agricultural residues. 
2097	SAF producers estimate the fuels can generate up to 80% greenhouse gas emissions saving relative to conventional fuels.Earlier this year, the government pledged to deliver the first-ever net-zero emissions transatlantic flight, powered by 100% sustainable aviation fuel by the end of 2023, and outlined a series of initiatives to address barriers to greater SAF use, including high fuel production costs, the need for significant investment to scale infrastructure and production, and feedstock availability.The announcement also follows the UK government’s launch in July of “Jet Zero,” its strategy to achieve net zero aviation by 2050, and the achievement of the world’s first sustainable fuel military transporter flight using 100% SAF by the RAF last month.UK Transport Secretary Mark Harper said: “For decades, flying from London to New York has symbolised aviation’s ability to connect people and drive international progress. It’s now going to be at the forefront of cutting carbon emissions from flying.”The Virgin Atlantic flight is expected to be powered by fuel made from waste oil and fats such as used cooking oil. 
2098	In order to achieve net zero status, the flight will be combined with carbon removal through biochar credits, a material which traps and stores carbon taken from the atmosphere.Virgin said that it will work with a consortium of partners for the flight, including Rolls-Royce, Boeing, Imperial College London, University of Sheffield, Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) and ICF. 
2099	The flight will be conducted on a Boeing 787s, powered by Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 engines.Shai Weiss, Virgin Atlantic CEO, said:“As an airline founded on and committed to innovation, we’re proud to lead a cross industry consortium of partners to make aviation history by operating the first ever 100% SAF flight across the Atlantic. Virgin Atlantic’s inaugural flight in 1984 was to New York and today it continues to be one of our most popular routes. It will be an honour to pave the way for this important business and leisure route to become even more sustainable.”
2100	Global governments have agreed to new goals aimed at ending biodiversity loss this decade, protect natural ecosystems and ramp biodiversity-related financing to developing nations, with the adoption today of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework at the COP15 UN Biodiversity Conference in Montreal, Canada.Key aspects of the new agreement are 2030 targets to effectively halt biodiversity loss and to protect at least 30% of terrestrial, inland water, and coastal and marine areas, seen as analogous to the global Paris Agreement climate goals to limit warming to 1.5°C.In a statement following the announced agreement, EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said:“I welcome the historic outcome of COP15. This agreement provides a good foundation for global action on biodiversity, complementing the Paris Agreement for Climate. Now the world has a double track of action for a sustainable global economy by 2050.”The new framework includes 4 long-term 2050 goals supported by 23 global 2030 targets. 
2101	The goals include maintaining, enhancing and restoring the integrity, connectivity and resilience of all ecosystems and increasing the area of natural ecosystems, halting human-induced species extinction, and equitably sharing the benefits from the utilization of genetic resources by 2050.Key 2030 goals include restoring 30% of degraded ecosystems, reducing the loss of areas of high biodiversity importance to near zero, phasing out subsidies that harm biodiversity by at least $500 billion per year, cutting global food waste in half, and reducing the introduction of invasive alien species by 50%.
2102	The agreement also calls for a significant increase in the mobilization of finance for biodiversity to at least $200 billion per year by 2030, and for developed countries to provide biodiversity-related financial resources, including official development assistance, to developing nations of at least $20 billion per year by 2025 and $30 billion by 2030.Calling the agreement a “major milestone for the conservation of our natural world,” WWF International Director General Marco Lambertini welcomed the new framework, adding that “a shared global goal that will guide collective and immediate action to halt and reverse nature loss by 2030 is an exceptional feat for those that have been negotiating the Global Biodiversity Framework, and a win for people and planet.”WWF warned, however, that weak language and the voluntary nature of the agreement could threaten the goals to halt biodiversity loss and preserve ecosystems. 
2103	Noting that the framework “lacks a mandatory ratcheting mechanism that will hold governments accountable to increase action if targets are not met,” Lambertini said:“We must now see immediate implementation of this agreement, no excuses, no delays – nature and all of us who rely on it for our livelihoods, economies and wellbeing have waited long enough, it’s time for nature to thrive again. Governments have chosen the right side of history in Montreal, but history will judge all of us if we don’t deliver on the promise made today.”
2104	Netherlands-based bank ABN AMRO announced the publication of its climate strategy, setting out its plan of action to bring its portfolios in line with a scenario limiting global warming to 1.5°C, and supporting the transition to a net zero economy by 2050.Along with the release of the climate strategy, ABN AMRO announced that it is joining the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NBZA).
2105	The NZBA was launched in April 2021, with a group of banks committing to align operational and attributable emissions from their portfolios with pathways to net-zero by 2050 or sooner. 
2106	The initiative has grown rapidly, and currently represents about 40% of global banking assets.In addition to aligning portfolios with a long-term net zero goal, NZBA signatories also commit to setting intermediate targets for 2030 or sooner. 
2107	ABN AMRO’s climate strategy includes 2030 targets for sectors including oil & gas, power generation, shipping, commercial real estate and mortgages.Along with steps to reduce its footprint and reach a net zero target for its operations by 2030, ABN AMRO said it aims to increase its lending commitment to renewables and other decarbonization technologies such as hydrogen fuel cells, renewable electricity, and carbon capture technology to at least Є4 billion by 2025.Additionally by 2030, the bank expects a total of up to Є1 billion in early-stage capital to be allocated to accelerate the transition to a decarbonized energy economy.
2108	We have seen a substantial surge in investment in net-zero tech, with investment reaching record highs in 2021 and remaining relatively resilient in 2022 despite a wider market downturn. 
2109	Yet there are significant challenges to developing and scaling the net-zero technologies needed in time to enable net zero by 2050. 
2110	The International Energy Agency estimates that to achieve net-zero emissions in the energy sector, the investment needed to develop, scale-up and deploy clean energy technologies would need to be between $4-5trn  per annum between 2030 and 2050.Many different net-zero technologies will have a role to play to transition to net zero and examples of some of the key focus areas include: the generation and storage of clean electricity, the electrification of transport and industry, the development of the supply and demand for green hydrogen as an energy source, the decarbonisation of building materials and the transformation of energy usage by the built environment, changes to agriculture and food distribution to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and the ability to capture and store carbon from the atmosphere at scale.Developing any one of these areas alone would be challenging but this widespread evolution of different technologies needs to occur in parallel, across the world, with solutions being, in many respects, inter-dependent – in short, a systems issue of immense scale and complexity costing tens of trillions of dollars to address.Investment will be needed across all stages of technology evolution – from the equity financing of deep-tech start-ups through to the high value project financing necessary to develop large scale facilities. 
2111	The sources of finance are similarly diverse with venture capital, private equity, sovereign wealth funds and pension funds all playing a part alongside corporates, banks, multilateral agencies, asset managers and national governments.Government carbon reduction policies and initiatives are essential to creating certainty for the investor community, enabling investors to invest in climate innovation with confidence.  
2112	Governments around the world are seeking to set clear policy goals and committing significant capital to promote net-zero technology investment, and to subsidise technologies they consider critical to the future of energy. 
2113	China has invested tens of billions of dollars into its clean energy sector over the last ten years, developing a strong global market share of technologies such as solar manufacturing and wind turbine manufacturing.   
2114	More recently, the US passed the Inflation Reduction Act which is reported to authorise $391bn in spending on energy and climate change.  
2115	At COP27 in November 2022, the European Investment Fund signed investments totalling €247m to enable five equity funds to back €2.5bn of climate action investment. 
2116	The UK launched a Net Zero Hydrogen Fund in 2022 with £240m of funding available for eligible low carbon hydrogen projects.There are challenges in attracting investment in nascent industries. 
2117	For example, Europe has around 40 giga-factories at different stages of development. 
2118	These have attracted and will need to continue to attract significant levels of institutional finance. 
2119	Northvolt, for example, has raised more than $3bn of debt and equity financing including a $1.6bn project financing for the construction of its first giga-factory.Investors have had to find ways to balance a range of risks in this evolving area covering the facility’s complex supply chain, construction of the facility and certainty of offtake, so they could build a bankable business case. 
2120	With the risks and challenges of such projects becoming better understood, we see continued interest from the banks, funds, and multilaterals for many other projects in the pipeline.Uncertainty in the interest rate environment will inevitably make financing more challenging for certain of the net zero projects/businesses through 2023 and we have already seen some high-profile companies facing liquidity issues. 
2121	Overall though, given the stated policy goals and the impact of the evolving ESG reporting regimes, we expect net-zero technology investment and M&A to remain a strong source of deal flow through 2023 and beyond.
2122	Companies reporting under the new climate disclosure standards being developed by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) of the IFRS Foundation will be given an additional year to report on Scope 3 emissions, or those originating in a company’s value chain and beyond its direct control, according to an announcement by the ISSB following its December meeting.Launched last year at the COP26 climate conference, the ISSB is currently in the process of developing its first 2 proposed standards for company sustainability and climate related disclosures around the end of this year, and to issue the final standards as early as possible in 2023. 
2123	Regulators in major jurisdictions around the world including Europe, the UK and the U.S., among others, have introduced or are preparing mandatory sustainability reporting requirements for companies, and most will be heavily influenced by the ISSB standards.Reporting requirements around Scope 3 emissions are one of the most controversial aspects of the emerging disclosure regimes. 
2124	These emissions very often account for the vast majority of many companies’ carbon footprints, but are typically the hardest to track and calculate, occurring outside of the direct control of companies, in areas such as supply chains, or in their customers’ use of their products.The ISSB confirmed in October that Scope 3 emissions disclosure will be included in its new climate reporting standard, but also said that it would develop “relief provisions” in order to help companies apply the Scope 3 requirements, possibly including giving companies more time to provide Scope 3 disclosures, as well as giving companies protection or reduced liability on disclosed Scope 3 information.As part of the series of guidance and reliefs set out at its December meeting, the ISSB agreed to a temporary exemption of a minimum of 1 year from the implementation of the climate standard, in order to give time for companies to implement processes.The ISSB also indicated that the standard will allow companies to include information not aligned with its reporting cycle if the information is collected from value chain companies with different reporting cycles.Additionally, the ISSB reported that it agreed to refine proposed requirements for financed emissions, which typically represent the bulk of financial institutions’ Scope 3 emissions, to support financial sector preparers with the measurement and disclosure of portfolio emissions.Sue Lloyd, Vice-Chair of the ISSB, said: “We recognise that companies need help, as best practice continues to develop, in measuring Scope 3 GHG emissions. The ISSB believes the reliefs and guidance agreed this week will provide companies with the time to get their processes in place, and the guidance to support this disclosure.”
2125	Finance professionals have welcomed increased clarity on financial flows to protect ecosystems around the world following global leaders’ agreement of the wording of the Kunming-Montreal global biodiversity framework (GBF) at COP15. 
2126	The framework, which has been under negotiation for four years with talks ramping up in Montreal over the past two weeks, sets out four goals and 23 targets for how countries will protect 30% of the planet for nature by 2030. 
2127	The agreement, which was reached on Monday and adopted by 196 countries under the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, includes a pledge to reform $500bn of environmentally damaging subsidiaries and $30bn a year by 2030 for conservation in the developing world and aims to “catalyse, enable and galvanise urgent and transformative action by governments, subnational and local governments, and with the involvement of all of society to halt and reverse biodiversity loss…”“It sends a clear, strong message to all stakeholders, including the financial sector,” said Sonya Likhtman, manager at Federated Hermes and co-chair of the public policy advocacy working group at the Finance for Biodiversity Foundation.
2128	“Goal D requires the alignment of financial flows with both the 2030 targets and the 2050 vision, securing a focus on implementation in the short, medium and long term. This goal, along with several targets that reference private financial flows, provides the hook required to stimulate and scale up action from the financial sector,” she said.Likhtman added she is also pleased target 15 requires governments to ensure that large companies and financial institutions assess and disclose their risks, impacts and dependencies on biodiversity throughout operations, value chains and portfolios.However, Katie Leach, head of biodiversity at responsible investment NGO ShareAction, said although the agreement was an important step, the wording was vague in some places and “non-specific targets in parts of the agreement could undermine the urgent action that’s needed to protect threatened wildlife and ecosystems”.
2129	She also commented success of the GBF will come down to “implementation and how the goals and targets are interpreted at a national level.”Gautier Queru, Land Degradation Neutrality fund project manager at Mirova, agreed more ambitious and quantitative objectives would have been preferable.  
2130	“Nevertheless, having this clear framework now will establish the design of the architecture of our indicators and methodologies on a solid foundation,” said Queru.ShareAction’s Leach encouraged mandatory disclosure of nature risks as a next step. 
2131	“Target 15 for all large and transnational businesses and financial institutions to assess and disclose their risks, dependencies and impacts on biodiversity has huge potential to drive action to halt and reverse biodiversity loss – governments should make it mandatory and call for implementation in line with the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures,” she said.Noeleen Cowley, head of FS ESG at KPMG UK said COP15 was first time the private sector has really been inside the ‘nature tent’ and also highlighted disclosures as a key part of the agreement.
2132	“A key aspect for the finance community has been around disclosures. Although many will be disappointed that the word ‘mandatory’ does not feature, as 330 institutions from 52 countries had called for, the text does provide an unambiguous message to firms to prepare to disclose their risks, dependencies and impacts on nature – and that stronger requirements from individual jurisdictions is coming down the line, by 2030 at the latest,” said Cowley.According to Robeco biodiversity equities strategy portfolio managers, Aaron Re’em and David Thomas, the agreement is a “great step forwards in tackling the twin challenges of nature preservation and funding.”“$200bn a year in global biodiversity financing by 2030 will rapidly spawn new markets for nature-based solutions,” they said.
2133	“The five-fold increase of $30bn in international financing by 2030 to developing countries will accelerate conservation efforts at the heart of biodiversity rich habitats, we hope especially for an increase in marine biodiversity investments, where it’s desperately needed.” 
2134	Re’em and Thomas said it was encouraging the agreement was tackling the contributors of biodiversity loss, including agriculture.
2135	“The framework’s mission to reduce excess nutrient loss in agriculture by 50% will lift regional commitments to the EU’s ambitious biodiversity strategy targets,” they noted.Target 19 of the agreement has reassured Queru that Mirova’s own strategy towards investing in natural capital is on the right track.  
2136	The target stated parties shall “substantially and progressively increase the level of financial resources from all sources… including by… leveraging private finance, promoting blended finance, implementing strategies for raising new and additional resources, and encouraging the private sector to invest in biodiversity, including through impact funds and other instruments.”Target 19 also encourages innovative schemes such as “payment for ecosystem services, green bonds, biodiversity offsets and credits, benefit-sharing mechanisms, with environmental and social safeguards.”Queru said: “Here both references to impact funds and innovative schemes such as biodiversity credits are very encouraging and confirm that what Mirova has developed for the past seven years in the field of natural capital investing is deemed relevant and useful. It is an incentive for us to do more and will only encourage us to accelerate.”Target 14 of the agreement tackles integration of biodiversity into “policies, regulations, planning and development processes, poverty eradication strategies, strategic environmental assessments, environmental impact assessments and, as appropriate, national accounting.”It noted all relevant public and private activities, fiscal and financial flows should be progressively aligned with the GBF’s goals.Sophie Lawrence, stewardship and engagement lead at Rathbone Greenbank Investments said the fact private financial flows needing to be aligned with the goals and targets of the GBF, alongside public finance, was “welcome”.
2137	However, Lawrence also said: “Significant concerns remain over the scale of finance committed by developed countries to developing nations given the scale of the problem, in addition to questions over whether the GBF is an effective mechanism for distributing funds equitably.”
2138	Carbon capture and removal technology provider Svante announced that it has raised $318 million, in a deal led by energy giant Chevron’s low-carbon solutions-focused business Chevron New Energies (CNE).
2139	Founded in 2007, Burnaby, British Columbia-based Svante provides structured adsorbent beds – or filters – and modular rotary contactor machines that capture and remove CO2 from industrial emissions, aimed at enabling emissions intensive industries to capture large-scale emissions from existing infrastructure. 
2140	The company’s solutions are targeted at industrial decarbonization activities in areas such as hydrogen, pulp and paper, lime, cement, steel, aluminum, and chemicals, and the technology can also be used for Direct Air Capture (DAC) solutions.Claude Letourneau, President and CEO of Svante:“We are working to remove the biggest barriers to rapid deployment of industrial carbon capture by building this manufacturing facility, which we expect will enable us to rapidly expand our order book.”The company said that the financing will support its commercial-scale filter manufacturing facility in Vancouver, expected to produce enough filter modules to capture millions of tonnes of CO2 per year.Chevron initially invested in Svante in 2014 through Chevron Technology Ventures, and the companies launched a pilot project in 2020 for the capture of CO2 from post combustion of natural gas.Chevron launched CNE last year, announcing plans to significantly ramp investments its low carbon businesses to over $10 billion by 2028.Chris Powers, vice president of CCUS with CNE, said:“We are advancing a full value chain carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) business and believe Svante is poised to be a leader in enabling carbon capture solutions.”The deal marks the latest major capital raise for carbon removal technologies, such as the $650 million equity financing earlier this year for DAC startup Climeworks.Following the announcement of the financing, J.P. Morgan, who served as lead placement agent on the deal, and also on the Climeworks capital raise, noted that it has advised on private equity capital raises of nearly $1 billion for carbon capture companies this year, roughly double that of the prior five years combined.J.P. Morgan Sustainability Executive Director Ben Ratner said: “Putting increasing capital to work on carbon capture efforts is one important way to serve businesses in the low carbon transition, balancing the continued need for heavy industry with the climate imperative. As we pursue our $1 trillion green financing target, there are promising opportunities to leverage innovative technologies across the energy system.”
2141	In a bid to reduce greenwashing the Federal Council has outlined a definition for sustainable investments and set up a working group to examine how this can be implemented.The Swiss body set out its position in a paper last week, stating financial products can only be labelled as sustainable if they align with one or more specific sustainability goal, or contribute to achieving one or more specific sustainability goal.Those that just aim to reduce ESG risk or optimise financial performance therefore cannot be described as sustainable.Definitions for sustainability goals can be broad, the paper said, for example they can be based on the Sustainable Development Goals and include transition targets.Products aimed at “contributing to the achievement of a sustainability goal” will typically be those using an impact approach or a credible active ownership approach, or both, the paper continued.The Federal Council also said a firm offering a sustainable product should be able to describe its approach and report on its goals regularly. 
2142	“This information should be public, easily accessible, transparent and comparable,” it said, including how alignment and/or impact is measured.These principles should be verified by a third party and “clients, investors and insured persons should have recourse to legal action” if the requirements are not complied with. 
2143	The Federal Council has instructed a working group, led by the Federal Department of Finance (FDF), to examine the best way to implement this. 
2144	In addition to the FDF, the working group will contain representatives from the Federal Department of the Environment, Transport, Energy and Communications; the Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research; the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority; and industry and non-governmental organisations.The FDF said it will present the Federal Council with proposals on the next steps by the end of September 2023.
2145	CCLA Investment Management has rallied 10 institutional investors with a combined £806bn assets under management and advice to call on companies to better protect the UK’s migrant seasonal workers.Quilter Cheviot, Epworth Investment Management, Sarasin & Partners and Schroders are among firms to have signed a statement calling on retail companies and companies sourcing staff from the UK agriculture supply chain to investigate recruitment costs that might be being unfairly paid by workers.
2146	“We have concerns about business models that rely on or benefit from modern slavery and/or precarious working conditions. These models are ultimately unsustainable, and risk destroying value in the long term,” the statement said.The group said migrant workers, recruited and employed through the government’s Seasonal Worker Scheme, “are being obliged to pay excessive fees to agents and middlemen in addition to other fees, travel and visa costs for crucial, but temporary roles, supporting the UK’s food sector”, to the tune of more than £35m in 2022 alone, some estimates predict.This comes as the UK government announced there will be 45,000 visas available for businesses to recruit seasonal workers next year, 15,000 more than at the start of this year.The investor group is therefore calling on companies to implement the Employer Pays Principle, which means no worker should pay for a job and that the employer should bear all recruitment costs.These costs leave workers open to a high risk of debt bondage, one of the key indicators of forced labour, the group said in the statement.
2147	“Experts who have interviewed seasonal workers have identified many indicators of forced labour,” said Dame Sara Thornton, the UK’s Independent Anti-Slavery Commissioner, now advising CCLA, who wrote to the UK government early this year expressing concern regarding the Seasonal Worker Scheme and reflecting on the much-delayed Seasonal Worker Scheme pilot review, launched on 24 December 2021.“This is happening today in the UK. Both government and business can and should do more,” said Thornton.In addition, some migrant workers in the UK have been deceived by promises of multi-year contracts, but due to late release of 8,000 visas, find themselves with only weeks of work and in substantial debt.This is despite the UK government’s commitments to tackling modern slavery and the International Labour Organization stating that no recruitment fees or related costs should be charged to, or otherwise borne by, workers or jobseekers. 
2148	However, in practice workers often have to take out loans at high interest rates or sign over assets and property to pay these fees and costs.Therefore, the investor group is also calling on the government to bring the UK Seasonal Worker Scheme in line with these international commitments.CCLA CEO Peter Hugh Smith said: “It is important that as investors, and effectively as owners of companies, we come together to help address the issue of modern slavery. It is so pervasive – likely in every supply chain – and as we see with this latest example, exists on our own soil. The City must step up and take action to ensure people are protected and that we are not profiting from hardship and misery.”The full list of signatories is: CCLA Investment ManagementCanada Life Asset ManagementCentral Finance Board of the Methodist ChurchEpworth Investment ManagementEvelyn PartnersPension Protection FundPIRCQuilter CheviotSarasin & PartnersSchroders
