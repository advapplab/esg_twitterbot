63	JPMorgan Chase announced the expansion of its 2030 financed emissions targets to a series of new carbon-intensive sectors including Aviation, Iron and Steel, and Cement. 
64	The targets were unveiled with the release of the firm’s 2022 Climate Report, highlighting JPMorgan’s progress and approach to addressing climate risks and opportunities for the firm and its clients.The new targets form part of the company’s commitment, announced in October 2020 , to align its financing activities with the goals of Paris Agreement, and to help clients navigate the challenges and capitalize on the long-term economic and environmental benefits of transitioning to a low-carbon world.The targets also mark an expansion of the sectors covered by the firm’s 2030 financed emissions goals. 
65	Last year, JPMorgan became the first large U.S. bank to set 2030 portfolio-level emissions intensity targets , which covered the Oil & Gas, Electric Power and Auto Manufacturing sectors. 
66	Financing activities typically make up the vast majority of financial institutions’ climate impact, with financed emissions often several times greater than operational emissions. 
67	In its Climate Report, JPMorgan noted that the six sectors now covered by its 2030 goals account for the majority of global emissions across the supply and demand side value chains of the global energy system. 
68	In addition to their contribution to global emissions, JPMorgan said that the sectors were chosen with consideration given to the technical and economic maturity of their available decarbonization pathways.Each of the new targets were made with the intention to align with the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) Net Zero by 2050 scenario , according to the report, and each focuses on emissions intensity, or the emissions produced per unit of output. 
69	The targets include a 31% reduction in emissions per ton of crude steel, a 29% reduction in emissions per ton of cementious product, and a 36% reduction in “tank-to-wake” Scope 1 emissions per revenue tonne kilometers (RTK) for passengers and freight for the aviation sector. 
70	The report also included an update on JPMorgan’s progress towards its existing 2030 sector goals, as of June 2022. 
71	While the firm reported significant progress in emissions intensity reductions in the Electric Power and Auto Manufacturing sectors, down 22% and 10% from a 2019 baseline, respectively, Oil & Gas sector intensity remained mostly flat. 
72	In the Electric Power sector, progress was attributed to clients shifting their generation mix to lower emissions sources, and JPMorgan’s increasing financing to companies and projects with lower emissions intensity, while Auto Manufacturing reductions were driven by “banking new and emerging pure-play EV manufacturers.” 
73	In the Oil & Gas sector, the report notes that a shift by companies’ fuel production mix towards oil and away from natural gas drove higher emissions intensity, following a higher natural gas mix in 2019 due to the pandemic and commodity market volatility. 
74	JPMorgan said that it aims to expand its targets to additional carbon-intensive sectors, and that it plans to re-evaluate its existing sector targets, and that the firm expects to publish its Scope 3 absolute financed emissions in 2023.Click here  to access JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Climate Report.
75	WiseEye – Enabled Energy-Saving Smart Office Solution to Debut at CES 2023 Himax Technologies, Inc.

We look forward to a fruitful collaboration towards the advancement of smart AI office applications and improved corporate sustainability practices,” said Mark Chen, Vice president of WiseEye Smart Image Sensing business at Himax.Source: GlobeNewswire
88	Iberdrola has obtained a favourable Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the development of one of its wind projects in Spain – the Iglesias wind farm in Castilla y León – which will have the world’s most powerful onshore wind turbines manufactured by Siemens Gamesa – the first 5.X platform equipment in Spain. 
89	The company is adapting this new wind energy production facility, which will have a capacity of 70 megawatts (MW), to meet all environmental requirements. 
90	It will also generate enough clean energy to supply more than 66,000 homes per year and will prevent the emission of 32,000 tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere per year. 
91	With an investment of approximately €72 million, the construction of this wind farm will have a significant local component, as it will employ civil works companies, such as the Burgos-based Copsa, labour, transporters, suppliers of raw materials (aggregates, concrete, steel, prefabricated products, etc.), cranes, auxiliary means, etc., as well as the promotion of industrial suppliers. 
92	It is expected that up to 260 professionals will be involved in the project during peak work periods. 
93	It will also have a regional vision, the nacelles will be assembled at the Siemens Gamesa plant in Agreda (Soria) and the gearboxes for the wind turbines, with 6 MW and 170 metres of rotor, will be manufactured in Lerma (Burgos). 
94	Various regional and national suppliers will also be responsible for producing different components, such as the wind turbine towers in Avilés and Linares.See related article: Iberdrola and EIB Sign a €70 Million Green Loan Agreement to Boost Renewable Energy in PortugalCOMPETITIVE ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL BALANCE Iberdrola has fully integrated the conservation of the biological diversity of ecosystems into its strategy, demonstrating that the supply of competitive, clean, and sustainable energy can effectively coexist with environmental balance. 
95	In this way, the company continues to implement solutions to promote the coexistence of renewable facilities and the habitats in which they are developed. 
96	Iberdrola will implement various initiatives at this wind farm to improve the visibility of its wind turbines and deter the presence of certain species of birds in the area, installing bird detection equipment to avoid any collisions. 
97	A NEW ENERGY LANDSCAPE THAT FIXES POPULATION IN RURAL AREAS With this new wind farm, Iberdrola will reinforce its commitment to Castilla y León, which is consolidating its position as a major centre for renewable developments in the company’s investment cycle to 2025, where it already manages more than 5,100 MW, making it the autonomous community with the most ‘green’ megawatts installed by the company.  
98	Iberdrola promotes renewable energies as an engine for rural development and in this way the villages emerge as a guarantee for the future. 
99	This is the case of the villages of Castile and Leon, surrounded by wind farms and photovoltaic plants that Iberdrola is promoting and which will contribute to a sustainable recovery, allowing the creation of local employment. 
100	In the province of Burgos alone, Iberdrola has recently built or is developing more than 550 megawatts between seven wind farms. 
101	The company is currently immersed in the construction of the Valdemoro and Buniel wind farms, and has recently started up its first photovoltaic plant in Castilla y León -Revilla-Vallejera-.
102	bp completed its purchase of Archaea Energy Inc., a leading provider of renewable natural gas (RNG), marking a milestone in the growth of bp’s strategic bioenergy business.

105	In October, bp announced it had agreed to acquire Archaea, subject to regulatory and Archaea shareholder approval. 
106	Having received those approvals and with the transaction complete, Archaea expands bp’s presence in the US biogas industry, enhancing its ability to support customers’ decarbonization goals and progressing its aim to reduce the average lifecycle carbon intensity of the energy products it sells.See related article: bp Invests $20 Million AUD in Low-Cost, Rapid Deployment Solar Provider 5B Bioenergy is one of five strategic transition growth engines that bp intends to grow rapidly through this decade. 
107	bp expects investment into its transition growth businesses to reach more than 40% of its total annual capital expenditure by 2025, aiming to grow this to around 50% by 2030.  
108	With the close of the agreement, Archaea common shares will cease to be listed on the NYSE.
109	Clean Energy Fuels Corp., the largest provider of the cleanest fuel for the transportation market, announced that it entered into a four-year $150 million sustainability-linked senior secured term loan with Riverstone Credit Partners L.P., a dedicated credit investment platform focused on energy, power, decarbonization, and infrastructure managed by Riverstone Holdings LLC. 
110	This financing provides Clean Energy with additional capital to execute its renewable natural gas (RNG) growth strategy as demand for RNG fuel rapidly rises. 
111	Clean Energy’s growth strategy includes the development of negative carbon intensity RNG projects and construction of new RNG fueling stations for transportation sector customers. 
112	Proceeds from the term loan will be used, in part, to help fund the company’s rapid expansion of RNG projects at dairies, which capture fugitive methane and turn it into a fuel made entirely from organic waste and reduces carbon emissions by an average of 300% versus diesel. 
113	Demand for the fuel continues to grow as customers like Republic Services, WM, UPS, LA Metro and New York City MTA continue to expand their RNG fleets.See related article: New Low-Carbon Hub Accelerator Designed to Bring Industries Together to Advance the Clean Energy Transition“As we articulated at the beginning of the year, we have big plans to increase our supply of RNG from dairies because when it ends up in the tank of a heavy-duty truck or a transit bus, it is rated cleaner than any other alternative in the marketplace,” said Andrew J. Littlefair, president and CEO of Clean Energy. 
114	“Our joint ventures with bp and TotalEnergies are having great success. We are currently constructing multiple RNG projects at dairies around the country with a healthy pipeline of other projects. This additional financing will allow us to stay on this rapid pace of development.” “Clean Energy pioneered RNG as a vehicle fuel and continues to be the largest provider of RNG for the transportation industry throughout North America. We are thrilled to partner with them on their quest to deliver fully zero-carbon RNG by 2025,” said Daniel Flannery, Managing Director at Riverstone. 
115	Clean Energy obtained a second party opinion from Sustainable Fitch that considered the transaction to be aligned with the five pillars of the Loan Syndications and Trading Association’s Sustainability-Linked Loan Principles.

122	Suburban Propane Partners, L.P., a nationwide distributor of propane and other energy products to local communities, as well as an investor in low carbon energy alternatives, announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Suburban Renewable Energy, LLC, reached an agreement to acquire a platform of renewable natural gas assets from Equilibrium Capital Group, a leading sustainability-driven asset management firm.  
123	In addition to the purchase of two operational biogas facilities, the parties have formed a partnership to serve as a long-term growth platform for the identification, development and operation of additional RNG projects; including an existing pipeline of identified RNG projects that are in various stages of development.Strategic Rationale The RNG platform to be acquired is diversified across feedstocks, geographies and revenue streams, and complements Suburban Renewables’ ongoing activity to construct, own and operate an RNG facility at Adirondack Farms in Peru, New York.  
124	While the acquisition will immediately enhance and increase Suburban Renewables’ presence in RNG production and distribution, the partnership with Equilibrium through the joint venture arrangement will provide visible growth and experienced management in the rapidly developing waste-to-energy economy.  
125	RNG can be produced from multiple organic waste streams; including agricultural and food waste, helping to reduce methane emissions, while offering a low carbon solution as a drop-in replacement for traditional natural gas.
126	“This investment meaningfully advances our strategic goal of building out a renewable energy platform to help drive the energy transition to a low carbon economy. We are excited to be partnering with the Equilibrium team, which has a proven track record of sourcing, developing and managing high quality renewable natural gas producing assets,” said Michael Stivala, President and Chief Executive Officer of Suburban Propane. 
127	“We look forward to building upon and advancing this opportunity as we seek to leverage Equilibrium’s seasoned management team with a well-established network of operators, engineering and construction providers and off-takers, and a strong commitment to sustainable investments. The scalable platform complements our existing portfolio of renewable energy assets, either as a stand-alone RNG distributor, or as a pathway to rDME and hydrogen production.”See related article: Osaka Gas USA, Tallgrass & Green Plains Partner to Advance Japan’s Climate Objectives “Bio-fuels and renewable natural gas are now mainstream commodities in the transition to low carbon energy and decarbonization of our economy. The major challenge will be scaling cost-effective production supplies to meet market demand. Equilibrium is taking our experience investing in, developing, and operating scalable RNG production infrastructure, and partnering with Suburban’s market leadership and expertise in gas logistics, trading and user applications, to build assets that drive towards these goals,” said Dave Chen, Chief Executive Officer of Equilibrium Capital.Transaction DetailsThe purchase price of $190.0 million for the two operating facilities, along with transaction fees and expenses, will be funded with borrowings of approximately $120.0 million under Suburban’s revolving credit facility, and the assumption of approximately $80.0 million of outstanding green bonds with an attractive interest rate. 
128	The RNG platform will include the following assets and the formation of an RNG development company with Equilibrium, as follows: The parties have cleared the necessary regulatory approvals for a simultaneous signing and closing of the transactions.

131	Luokung Technology Corp., a leading spatial-temporal intelligent big data services company and provider of interactive location-based services in China, announced that its operating affiliate, Luokung Remote Sensing Technology Co., Ltd. has signed agreements with the government of PingYuan county, MeiZhou city in Guangdong province to provide carbon sink project development and carbon emission and carbon neutrality data services covering the entire county, including but not limited to the fields of forestry, agriculture, grasslands, wetlands, clean energy and industry. 
132	Luokung’s carbon peaking and carbon neutrality data service model, which includes the PingYuan project, has been replicated in several counties across the country. 
133	Forecasting based on existing contracts, we project that over 10 million tons of carbon assets will be traded on the market in the next five years, with revenue of more than US$70 million for the company. 
134	Facilitated by the multi-source heterogeneous spatial-temporal big data processing capabilities, intelligent real-time remote sensing service technology and advanced self-developed algorithms integrating with dynamic remote sensing data, Luokung has formed its “dual carbon” data service platform with coverage of multi-fields, multi-timelines and multi-space lines, enabling local governments to establish cost-efficient, accurate and effective systems for carbon sink accounting, carbon emission monitoring and natural resources investigation and monitoring, enabling the Company to participate in the carbon assets trading market under the VCS/CCER protocols. 
135	The Company expects its new product to meet the needs of local governments to achieve positive outcomes for natural resource conservation and economic development.See related article: Japan’s Mitsui OSK, Kansai Electric sign MoU on carbon capture and storage Mr. Xuesong Song, Luokung’s Chairman and CEO, stated: “We are pleased to announce that one of Luokung’s business sectors, carbon neutrality and natural resources management, has made significant progress. With the active expansion in this area in the last six months, the Company has served many counties across the country as a “dual carbon” data service provider, which we believe is a testament of the market’s trust and recognition of Luokung’s capabilities in carbon neutrality and natural resource management data services. 
136	There are nearly 3,000 counties in China, which represents a tremendous market potential for further expansion. 
137	Luokung is prepared to build upon the positive momentum and plans to continue to take  an active role in net zero emissions and sustainable development.
138	"You can add ""CCS"" — shorthand for carbon capture and storage — to the short list of controversial, three-letter green investment practices (think ESG) in the run-up to a net-zero economy. "
139	CCS is either the climate tech breakthrough of the 21st century, according to its advocates, or a multibillion-dollar boondoggle, say  activists. 
140	"Proponents claim that innovative, ""negative emissions"" CCS technology will play a major role in decarbonizing the global economy as part of an ""all of the above"" strategy required to make progress to net zero by 2050. "
141	Critics retort that CCS is an uneconomical distraction that misdirects investments that should be put toward the renewables needed to achieve the clean energy transition. 
142	Furthermore, it is championed by a fossil fuel industry that is the root source of generating the emissions that are the problem it proposes to resolve. 
143	So, CCS: Scheme or scam? 
144	The pros and cons are several and knotty, and answers so far are conditional — it’s complicated. 
145	The basic premise of CCS proffers a boldly simple solution to a complex issue. 
146	If there’s too much CO2 in the atmosphere, why not just remove it, transport it and bury it deep underground? 
147	While the CCS idea has been around for some time, it’s gathered much more traction recently. 
148	That’s because it has attracted increasingly large amounts of investment from those who think it a potentially profitable clean tech practice.This largesse is coming from both government and companies, notably the turbocharge given to it recently by the Biden administration. 
149	The Inflation Reduction Act allocates $369 billion to address climate change, and directs a significant portion to CCS — $7 billion — through expanded tax credits, raising its subsidy from $50 to $85 a metric ton. 
150	With the removal of millions of metric tons of CO2 being projected, that’s a lot of financial support. 
151	The bill also simplifies the process for receiving those tax credits, and it opens  the subsidy to smaller carbon capture projects.
152	"""We cannot overemphasize the transformative effect that the Inflation Reduction Act will have on the deployment of carbon capture technologies,"" said  Matt Bright, carbon capture policy manager at the Clean Air Task Force.Companies have noticed. "
153	As of now, there are 153 CCS projects in the planning phase, more than at any time in history, according to  the Global CCS Institute in its recently published annual survey. 
154	"They join 30 projects already operating and 11 under construction.The list of major CCS projects includes the recently announced partnership of ExxonMobil and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to deploy carbon capture technology as a ""solution"" for industrial customers. "
155	Both companies claim  more than 30 years experience in the field, with Mitsubishi having delivered 14 commercial capture plants worldwide.In another initiative, Exxon is partnering with CF Industries to capture and store up to 2 million metric tons of CO2 emissions annually from a plant in Louisiana, projecting a market of $4 trillion for CCS activities by 2050. 
156	Competing oil major Occidental Petroleum is building a plant to capture 500,000 metric tons of CO2 and earn money by selling carbon offsets. 
157	"The company is also projecting  profits from selling ""net-zero oil"" produced by injecting more CO2 into oil reservoirs. "
158	Occidental’s strategy points to another often-hyped benefit of CCS projects: The ability to use captured and stored CO2 for other purposes. 
159	From fizzy drinks to fertilizer production, CO2 is a major component in industries that depend on the gas. 
160	More controversially, another use for captured CO2 is the pumping of the compressed gas into old oil wells to retrieve the remaining hydrocarbons, thereby enhancing fossil fuel production — an end result exactly contrary to that of reducing emissions in the first place. 
161	Big oil and gas companies have been doing CCS for years, as a matter of business-as-usual — exactly what activists say is so wrong-headed about using this technology as a solution to climate change. 
162	If oil and gas production and consumption is not reduced overall by 2050, they argue, there will be no achievement of a net-zero economy by that target date. 
163	Energy companies reply that commercial uses for captured carbon gas provide the bottom-line incentive to invest in and operate the process. 
164	And that they are best-positioned by their resources and experience to manage it.Other, non-energy corporations are joining up with startups to take advantage of this newly favorable climate for CCS. 
165	Three big deals have just recently been concluded, among them a long-term commitment by Microsoft to support Heirloom, a San Francisco-based firm; the tech giant is both investor and customer, receiving  carbon credits in return for its investment.Investors have fixated on the profit potential. 
166	In one example, Brookfield Asset Management has committed  up to $2 billion for three carbon capture businesses. 
167	Plants at one of the project developments, LanzaTech NZ, will convert the gas from industrial emissions into materials used in fuels, clothes and perfume.Naysayers say: Not so fast. 
168	A report by Institute for Energy Economics and Financial analysis IIEEFA finds  that the majority of 13 CCS projects currently operating have either failed entirely or captured much less CO2 than expected. 
169	They also tell an alternate story about the promise of CCS. 
170	It’s a fact that the current landscape of active operations is a fairly small one that is currently not making much of a difference in the larger scheme of things. 
171	In 2021, around 40 million metric tons of CO2 was captured by existing CCS projects. 
172	To achieve net zero, that number would have to grow 40 times, to 1.7. 
173	billion tons of CO2 removed over the next eight years. 
174	Current and planned projects would mitigate 244 million metric tons of CO2 annually, less than 1 percent of the 36 billion metric tons of the gas that the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates was added to the atmosphere last year. 
175	So, even with a land rush to invest in CCS/CCUS, there’s not nearly enough projected activity to produce outcomes on a scale equal to the resources being poured into the concept — and to fulfill its purpose of emissions reduction.
176	"""We’re still far short of the scale to achieve and help achieve net zero,"" admits Jarad Daniel, CEO of the Global CCS Institute. "
177	"""The installed capacity needs to increase by at least a hundredfold between now and 2050."" "
178	The IEA has said much more capacity is needed than the Institute’s projected figure of 425-650 million metric tons to be removed annually by 2050; the IEA figure is much higher, 1.6 billion metric tons. 
179	Its figure for required growth  in investment in CCS to contribute meaningfully to net zero by 2050: 1,700 percent. 
180	That’s an impossible, target, say critics.Investments in CCS have exponentially increased in response. 
181	Global funding for CCS grew four times in 2021, to $1.44 billion, according to  data from CB insights. 
182	Up to 2020, investments in CCS amounted to only 0.5 percent of investment in all forms of clean energy investments up to 2020.Undeterred by these daunting figures and controversies, the World Economic Forum’s First Movers Coalition, which aims to accelerate industrial decarbonization through advanced market commitments to climate tech, includes  CO2 removal as of its core goals. 
183	The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the IEA also tout the idea as likely to play an important role in addressing climate change. 
184	Will CCS be a critical part of reducing emissions in industries that are particularly hard to decarbonize, such as steel and cement? 
185	Or will the technology turn out to be an ultra-expensive detour that soaks up valuable investment funding that could be directed to turbocharge renewables, solar and wind energy? 
186	Billions of dollars as well as the health of the planet are riding on the bets being made during the CCS debate — winning ones to be determined.
