0	"The No. 1 question I (still) get asked by job seekers is ""What certification should I get if I want to work in sustainability?"" "	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
1	I wrote an article  last year that attempted to answer that question and continues to be a reader favorite. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
2	The landscape has shifted since then, and some exciting new certifications are available, so read on to learn what’s new and which certifications might work for you.GreenBiz's 2022 State of the Profession report  showed that credentials from the Global Reporting Initiative and the U.S Green Building Council (LEED GA and LEED AP) continue to be the leading certifications, with 46 percent, 23 percent and 20 percent of survey respondents holding them, respectively. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
3	CDP was specifically mentioned as the disclosure framework most used by respondents. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
4	That makes a lot of sense, as several voluntary standards and frameworks are available for writing your organization’s sustainability/ESG/CSR report, but there’s only one way to disclose to CDP and receive a score. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
5	Unfortunately, CDP doesn’t offer an official certification for professionals, but I’m betting that if it did, it would be on the next report’s top five list for sure. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
6	"Speaking of reporting, sustainability reporting (frequently referred to as ""ESG reporting"") is a specific skillset within the broader sustainability profession that’s in particularly high demand. "	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
7	The GreenBiz report shared that 85 percent of surveyed companies have either hired more people or engaged consultants specifically in response to increased investor demand related to ESG disclosure. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
8	The report also stated that while reporting used to be considered a function that required 0.5 full-time equivalent (FTE), or half of a full-time employee’s workload, the average number of FTEs dedicated to reporting is now closer to 2. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
9	It’s pretty clear reporting skills are in demand right now, and reporting is a skillset that’s relevant to virtually any industry, so if you’re interested in reporting, one of the reporting certifications listed below might be a great option for you.     	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
10	But what if reporting isn’t your thing? 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
11	The GreenBiz report also had a fantastic chart that showed what areas sustainability professionals are seeking more education in to help advance their sustainability careers. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
12	ESG and sustainable finance was at the top (I’m assuming ESG reporting is included in that), and environmental skills including climate, carbon, waste and water came in at a close second. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
13	Those top two categories are at the core of most corporate sustainability work, but it was particularly exciting to see circular economy, equity and social justice, and human rights in the supply chain achieving double-digit interest.  	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
14	So, now that you know what skills are generally in demand and popular, you need to do some critical thinking about what skills you personally might want to build by pursuing a professional certification. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
15	Take a close look at the job descriptions that excite you: What subject matter expertise or certifications do they call for? 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
16	Talk to people who are already doing the type of work you want to do: What training do they have? 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
17	What frameworks and tools do they use? 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
18	That should help you identify what certifications might make you a more competitive candidate. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
19	Also remember that professional certifications are not the only way to gain credibility. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
20	They should be only one part of your larger plan for gaining experience, which could include other avenues such as taking on new projects at your current job, fellowships , school, classes and skills-based volunteering. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
21	The below list includes 40 certifications that will help you understand the landscape of professional certifications in sustainability. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
22	The focus is on professional certifications for practitioners only or, put another way, certifications that demonstrate that you as a person have a specific skill or knowledge set. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
23	The list does NOT include certifications for products (such as Forest Stewardship Council or Cradle to Cradle) or for companies (such as B Corp). 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
24	It also doesn’t include professional training that does not earn a credential (I have some great suggestions for that in this article and in the Training section of my Education page ), or graduate programs or university-based certificates.  	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
25	I’m 100 percent confident that at least one reader out there will know of an incredible certification program that I’ve missed. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
26	If that’s you, please let me know about it by joining the conversation on LinkedIn, and I’ll include a shout-out to you and the certification in a thank-you post. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz

31	The International Society of Sustainability Professionals (ISSP)The Association of Climate Change Officers (ACCO)GreenBiz Leadership DevelopmentIf you’ve been following the news about the rapidly evolving sustainability and ESG reporting landscape, and you’re confused about what recent developments mean for the future value of any certification you might get, you’re not alone. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
32	There are a lot of reporting and disclosure approaches out there, but six recent leaders are: The SASB, CDSB and (IR) standards have been consolidated into the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) Foundation, which is developing a new set of global reporting standards that will ultimately be called the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
33	SASB and (IR) training and certification programs are still available while the new standards are under development and are likely to still be worth your time as they will inform the new standards.  	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
34	The European Union is developing the European Sustainability Reporting Standard (ESRS), which will be informed by all six frameworks listed above. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
35	It is expected to become law affecting companies that operate in the EU beginning this year.  	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
36	GRI, TCFD and CDP remain independent. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
37	The organizations are collaborating in various ways to support the development of ESRS and the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard.  	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
38	That’s a whole lot of acronyms in a very small space, but the key takeaway here is that most major players in sustainability reporting and disclosure are generally working together to develop a new set of global standards. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
39	A unified system is not here yet, but it’s on the way.  	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
40	My advice is to ask practitioners in the industry that you’d like to work in what approach they use to reporting and decide that way. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
41	If you later find out that you need to know a different standard for a particular role, you can learn it on the job or through a training program at that time. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
42	Each of the below standards has its own nuanced definition of what makes a building sustainable and approach for how building certification is achieved. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
43	Professional certification in one of them means you’ve demonstrated an understanding of sustainability and green building principles, in general, as well as the certification framework of the particular program.  	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
44	Green building certifications are of most value to people whose work will focus on building design, construction or retrofitting, such as designers and architects. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz
45	That said, the built environment is a huge component of environmental impact for many organizations, so those hoping to work in sustainability strategy or program management may find this training beneficial as well. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/40-sustainability-certifications	GreenBiz

74	Tokyo-based banking and financial services company Mizuho announced a series of initiatives aimed at supporting its climate and sustainable finance goals, including the establishment of a new financing framework to help assess the credibility and transparency of clients’ transition plans, and new interim financed emissions reduction targets for the Oil & Gas and Thermal coal mining sectors.The announcement forms part of a series of climate-focused moves by Mizuho, including the launch last year of the company’s net zero transition plan, with goals to achieve carbon neutrality in operations by 2030, and targets to reduce Scope 3 financed emissions. 	https://www.esgtoday.com/mizuho-launches-framework-to-assess-credibility-of-client-climate-transition-strategies/	ESGToday
75	Mizuho was the first Japanese financial institution to join the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) , committing to measure and disclose the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions impact of its loans and investments. 	https://www.esgtoday.com/mizuho-launches-framework-to-assess-credibility-of-client-climate-transition-strategies/	ESGToday
76	Mizuho has also set a goal to facilitate 12 trillion yen ($85 billion) of environmental finance between 2019 – 2030. 	https://www.esgtoday.com/mizuho-launches-framework-to-assess-credibility-of-client-climate-transition-strategies/	ESGToday
77	According to a statement by Mizuho, the new framework is aimed at helping the company more proactively supply financing to support clients’ business structure transformation, once the firm confirms that a client’s transition strategy meets Mizuho’s internal verification process. 	https://www.esgtoday.com/mizuho-launches-framework-to-assess-credibility-of-client-climate-transition-strategies/	ESGToday
78	The criteria outlined for verification under the framework include strategy and materiality, disclosure, governance structure, and science-based targets. 	https://www.esgtoday.com/mizuho-launches-framework-to-assess-credibility-of-client-climate-transition-strategies/	ESGToday
79	The verification process includes engagement with clients, review by specialist departments of the transition strategy, and monitoring by a risk management department.The firm stated that it will provide financing for business structure transformation even for clients in high-risk areas, once the client’s strategy meets the standards. 	https://www.esgtoday.com/mizuho-launches-framework-to-assess-credibility-of-client-climate-transition-strategies/	ESGToday
80	Mizuho said:“This may result in a temporary increase in our exposure in high-risk areas. However, assisting our clients with their transition strategy design and execution enables us to manage our transition risk appropriately and mitigate our medium- to long-term transition risk.” 	https://www.esgtoday.com/mizuho-launches-framework-to-assess-credibility-of-client-climate-transition-strategies/	ESGToday
81	The framework is currently being implemented with clients in the electric power sector. 	https://www.esgtoday.com/mizuho-launches-framework-to-assess-credibility-of-client-climate-transition-strategies/	ESGToday
82	Mizuho’s new financed emissions goals include targets to reduce Oil & Gas upstream production Scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity by 36% and to reduce Scope 3 emissions by 12% – 29% by 2030, compared to 2019. 	https://www.esgtoday.com/mizuho-launches-framework-to-assess-credibility-of-client-climate-transition-strategies/	ESGToday

We expect further development in the measurement, reporting and governance of ESG metrics in the next few years.” 	https://www.esgtoday.com/companies-double-use-of-environmental-dei-metrics-in-exec-incentive-comp-in-2022-wtw-survey/	ESGToday
93	The report also highlighted differences by region and sector in the incorporation of ESG metrics into compensation. 	https://www.esgtoday.com/companies-double-use-of-environmental-dei-metrics-in-exec-incentive-comp-in-2022-wtw-survey/	ESGToday
94	Europe had the highest proportion of companies utilizing ESG metrics for incentive plans at 91%, with the US at the lowest with 69%. 	https://www.esgtoday.com/companies-double-use-of-environmental-dei-metrics-in-exec-incentive-comp-in-2022-wtw-survey/	ESGToday

98	During my two decades with a career in responsible business, I have seen it evolve from philanthropy to corporate social responsibility (CSR), and nowadays, what is more commonly known as Environmental, Social, Governance (ESG). 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/evolution-responsible-business	GreenBiz
99	Some might argue that these are all just trending buzzwords for the same thing, but I think they’re all subtly different from each other, and it’s worth understanding where they come from to help inform your career direction. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/evolution-responsible-business	GreenBiz
100	I’ve worked across the spectrum of responsible business, so here is a glimpse at the evolution and what I’ve learned along the way. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/evolution-responsible-business	GreenBiz
101	When you think about philanthropy, Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, MacKenzie Scott, or a similar figure may come to mind. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/evolution-responsible-business	GreenBiz
102	These are individuals who have amassed great fortune through business and decided to give some of it back to society. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/evolution-responsible-business	GreenBiz
103	What they do forms a critical part of civil society. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/evolution-responsible-business	GreenBiz
104	And through philanthropic work — often delivered and funded through foundations, trusts and NGOs — there remain plenty of job opportunities. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/evolution-responsible-business	GreenBiz
105	We can actually trace the concept as far back as the Victorian era, where companies such as the Carnegies, Cadbury’s, or the Tatas had owners that were philanthropically minded and concerned with their contribution to communities. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/evolution-responsible-business	GreenBiz
106	But this type of philanthropy has started to fade in the modern era. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/evolution-responsible-business	GreenBiz
107	Next was CSR, which had its genesis in philanthropy, but is less paternalistic and focuses more on how a company engages and contributes back to the wellbeing of the communities in which it operates. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/evolution-responsible-business	GreenBiz
108	Beyond simply caring for its employees, companies started looking for a benefit back to itself. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/evolution-responsible-business	GreenBiz
109	Often, the motivator is reputation building, increasing its customer base or creating a talent pipeline. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/evolution-responsible-business	GreenBiz
110	While I was at the BBC, we developed a range of CSR initiatives which included making our campus buildings more accessible to local communities, supporting citizen journalism, organizing employee volunteering and ensuring the corporation became less London-centric. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/evolution-responsible-business	GreenBiz
111	CSR remains an important component of being a responsible company and for many it can often be the starting point for a career. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/evolution-responsible-business	GreenBiz
112	But the evolution of CSR to ESG presents significant and step-change. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/evolution-responsible-business	GreenBiz
113	The movement from CSR to ESG reframes responsible business practices from a reputation building exercise to creating opportunities for business success including financial reward, long-term adaptation, market differentiation and others. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/evolution-responsible-business	GreenBiz
114	This change is also a chance for new faces to jump into the career. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/evolution-responsible-business	GreenBiz
115	Many aspects of CSR and responsible business have become hygiene factors, basic table stakes requirements that without a company is likely to get called out but having them isn’t winning it any merits. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/evolution-responsible-business	GreenBiz
116	Regulatory demands together with greater awareness amongst stakeholders such as customers, employees, suppliers, investors and public bodies have led businesses to realize they must take action and consider how to mitigate risk while driving value for stakeholders, society and the planet.According to KPMG’s 2022 Survey of Sustainability Reporting, 96 percent of G250 companies report on sustainability or ESG matters . 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/evolution-responsible-business	GreenBiz
117	It’s clear that we are seeing the emergence of ESG as a business imperative. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/evolution-responsible-business	GreenBiz
118	ESG takes a holistic approach to doing business. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/evolution-responsible-business	GreenBiz
119	It’s about embedding responsible practice into a company’s strategy, operations, products and culture. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/evolution-responsible-business	GreenBiz
120	It focuses not only on minimizing risk but also maximizing opportunities. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/evolution-responsible-business	GreenBiz
121	In contrast, CSR is often managed and delivered by a dedicated team and rarely has a direct impact on a company's product/service or even business strategy. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/evolution-responsible-business	GreenBiz
122	The focus is primarily on community engagement, environmental impact of offices and factories, and responsible employment practices. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/evolution-responsible-business	GreenBiz
123	ESG also signals to investors and other stakeholders that a company is taking these aspects seriously by measuring quantitatively, actually making changes in business processes and viewing the entire business through a responsible business lens. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/evolution-responsible-business	GreenBiz
124	Put more simply, ESG is a set of commitments that deliver on a company’s purpose. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/evolution-responsible-business	GreenBiz
125	For example, at HubSpot, we believe that purpose is more than a buzzword — it powers everything that we do and is at the center of our ESG work. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/evolution-responsible-business	GreenBiz
126	Establishing our clear purpose of building a company future generations would be proud of helps us navigate which initiatives stack up to our goals and ensure that we prioritize what matters most to our stakeholders and also where we can have the greatest impact. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/evolution-responsible-business	GreenBiz
127	While some may find all this rather bureaucratic, especially with increasing regulation and compliance coming into force across most geographies, I see it as an opportunity. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/evolution-responsible-business	GreenBiz
128	It means that wanting to build a career in responsible business isn’t restricted to the ESG department. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/evolution-responsible-business	GreenBiz
129	You can now pursue careers in ethical marketing, sustainable design, carbon-friendly coding, carbon accounting or even circular economy engineering. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/evolution-responsible-business	GreenBiz
130	ESG is part of everything. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/evolution-responsible-business	GreenBiz
131	The evolution over the past several years has transformed a once small philanthropy or CSR team to a management discipline where responsible business is prioritized across the entire company. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/evolution-responsible-business	GreenBiz
132	Consequently, this expertise is needed now more than ever, and presents great opportunities for those seeking a purpose-led career. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/evolution-responsible-business	GreenBiz
133	All this said, we shouldn’t get too hung up on terminology. 	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/evolution-responsible-business	GreenBiz
134	I have no doubt that something else will replace ESG in the future and I propose we ought to see this as a dynamic and iterative process where the changing is for the better.	https://www.greenbiz.com/article/evolution-responsible-business	GreenBiz
135	Iberdrola is progressing according to plan in the construction project in the waters off Brittany in France for the Saint-Brieuc offshore wind farm. 	https://esgnews.com/iberdrola-completes-first-phase-of-construction-of-the-saint-brieuc-offshore-wind-farm/	ESGNews
136	The company has completed the first campaign of the works with the installation of 65% of the piles and 40% of the offshore wind platforms of the plant. 	https://esgnews.com/iberdrola-completes-first-phase-of-construction-of-the-saint-brieuc-offshore-wind-farm/	ESGNews
137	These elements have been manufactured at Windar’s facilities in Avilés and Navantia’s in Fene , respectively.In total, 124 piles have already been installed, which will anchor the substation and 40 of the 62 wind turbines of the wind farm to the seabed.  	https://esgnews.com/iberdrola-completes-first-phase-of-construction-of-the-saint-brieuc-offshore-wind-farm/	ESGNews
138	These cylindrical pieces of steel, eache 2.6 meters in diameter and weighing 150 tonnes, are between 18 and 47 meters long. 	https://esgnews.com/iberdrola-completes-first-phase-of-construction-of-the-saint-brieuc-offshore-wind-farm/	ESGNews
139	On them are fitted, with milimetre precision, each of the three-legged platforms that will support the turbines During this first phase, which has just been completed, the installation of 24 of these platforms has also been completed (about 40% of the total planned). 	https://esgnews.com/iberdrola-completes-first-phase-of-construction-of-the-saint-brieuc-offshore-wind-farm/	ESGNews
140	These triangular-based foundations are up to 75 meters high, 25 meters wide and weigh 1,150 tonnes. 	https://esgnews.com/iberdrola-completes-first-phase-of-construction-of-the-saint-brieuc-offshore-wind-farm/	ESGNews
141	They are assembled in three stages. 	https://esgnews.com/iberdrola-completes-first-phase-of-construction-of-the-saint-brieuc-offshore-wind-farm/	ESGNews
142	The first  stage consists of lifting the structure from a transport barge and placing it on site with a crane. 	https://esgnews.com/iberdrola-completes-first-phase-of-construction-of-the-saint-brieuc-offshore-wind-farm/	ESGNews
143	During the second stage, the three legs of the frame are inserted into the piles previously fixed to the seabed, ready for the subsequent sealing of the lower parts of the legs.Thanks to their lattice structure, the platforms have a very limited impact on the environment , facilitating the circulation of water masses and biodiversity, while promoting the artificial reef effect. 	https://esgnews.com/iberdrola-completes-first-phase-of-construction-of-the-saint-brieuc-offshore-wind-farm/	ESGNews
144	During the month of January, the project will continue with the installation of the cabling between wind turbines, depending on weather conditions. 	https://esgnews.com/iberdrola-completes-first-phase-of-construction-of-the-saint-brieuc-offshore-wind-farm/	ESGNews
145	In mid-January 2023, work is scheduled to begin on laying the wind farm’s interconnection cable. 	https://esgnews.com/iberdrola-completes-first-phase-of-construction-of-the-saint-brieuc-offshore-wind-farm/	ESGNews
146	In total, 90 kilometers  of 66 kV high-voltage alternating current interconnection cables will be commissioned.  	https://esgnews.com/iberdrola-completes-first-phase-of-construction-of-the-saint-brieuc-offshore-wind-farm/	ESGNews
147	Drilling and pile installation work will resume in the first quarter, when anchoring of the remaining 66 piles will begin. 	https://esgnews.com/iberdrola-completes-first-phase-of-construction-of-the-saint-brieuc-offshore-wind-farm/	ESGNews
148	Thus, in the second half of the year, work on the offshore wind platforms will resume and the assembly of the wind turbines will begin.See related article: Iberdrola and Basque Startup Woza to Shield Power Lines from Climate ChangeThe contract for the construction of Saint-Brieuc – valued at €350 million  – has been the largest order to date executed by the Navantia and Windar partnership in offshore wind power.  	https://esgnews.com/iberdrola-completes-first-phase-of-construction-of-the-saint-brieuc-offshore-wind-farm/	ESGNews

150	In addition, Navantia-Windar has opened a plant in Brest, France , where the 186 stabbings and intermediate platforms of the transition pieces and the lattice structure for 34 of the 62 structures of the park have been manufactured, generating 250 jobs. 	https://esgnews.com/iberdrola-completes-first-phase-of-construction-of-the-saint-brieuc-offshore-wind-farm/	ESGNews
151	Thanks to the contracts awarded by Iberdrola, Navantia has become a global benchmark in the construction of offshore wind power components and the leading supplier of this type of structures in France, with one of the greatest development potentials in this industry in Europe.  	https://esgnews.com/iberdrola-completes-first-phase-of-construction-of-the-saint-brieuc-offshore-wind-farm/	ESGNews
152	In total, Iberdrola has already awarded Navantia-Windar contracts worth more than 1 billion euros, including the award to Windar of the transition parts for the Baltic Eagle offshore wind farm in Germany and Vineyard Wind 1 in the United States, as well as the orders already completed for Wikinger in the Baltic Sea and East Anglia One in the United Kingdom. 	https://esgnews.com/iberdrola-completes-first-phase-of-construction-of-the-saint-brieuc-offshore-wind-farm/	ESGNews
153	This collaboration is an example of Iberdrola’s commitment to generate alliances with suppliers as an opportunity to develop a value chain in the country and position Spanish industry as an international benchmark in green projects. 	https://esgnews.com/iberdrola-completes-first-phase-of-construction-of-the-saint-brieuc-offshore-wind-farm/	ESGNews

169	The World Bank is seeking to vastly expand its lending capacity to address climate change and other global crises and will negotiate with shareholders ahead of April meetings on proposals that include a capital increase and new lending tools, according to an “evolution roadmap” seen by Reuters on Monday. 	https://esgnews.com/world-bank-seeks-more-funds-to-address-climate-change-other-crises/	ESGNews
170	The roadmap document – sent to shareholder governments – marks the start of a negotiation process to alter the bank’s mission and financial resources and shift it away from a country- and project-specific lending model used since its creation at the end of World War Two. 	https://esgnews.com/world-bank-seeks-more-funds-to-address-climate-change-other-crises/	ESGNews
171	The World Bank management aims to have specific proposals to change its mission, operating model and financial capacity ready for approval by the joint World Bank and International Monetary Fund Development Committee in October, according to the document. 	https://esgnews.com/world-bank-seeks-more-funds-to-address-climate-change-other-crises/	ESGNews
172	A World Bank spokesman said that the document aimed to provide details on the scope, approach, and timetable for the evolution, with regular updates for shareholders and decisions later in the year. 	https://esgnews.com/world-bank-seeks-more-funds-to-address-climate-change-other-crises/	ESGNews
173	The development lender will explore options like a potential new capital increase, changes to its capital structure to unlock more lending and new financing tools such as guarantees for private sector loans and other ways to mobilize more private capital, according to the document.But the World Bank Group (WBG) is not ready to bow to demands from some non-profit organizations to abandon its longstanding top-tier credit rating to boost lending, stating: “Management will explore all options that increase the capacity of the WBG whilst maintaining the AAA rating of the WBG entities.” 	https://esgnews.com/world-bank-seeks-more-funds-to-address-climate-change-other-crises/	ESGNews
174	U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has called for the World Bank and others to revamp their business models to boost lending and harness private capital to fund investments that more broadly benefit the world, such as helping middle-income countries transition away from coal power.See related article: World Bank and Banco do Brasil Develop $500 Million Climate Finance Solution A U.S. Treasury spokesperson declined comment on the World Bank document. 	https://esgnews.com/world-bank-seeks-more-funds-to-address-climate-change-other-crises/	ESGNews
175	The bank said proposals under consideration include higher statutory lending limits, lower equity-to-loan requirements and the use of callable capital – money pledged but not paid in by member governments – for lending. 	https://esgnews.com/world-bank-seeks-more-funds-to-address-climate-change-other-crises/	ESGNews
176	Development experts say this shift would greatly increase the amount of lending compared to the current capital structure, which only utilizes paid-in capital.	https://esgnews.com/world-bank-seeks-more-funds-to-address-climate-change-other-crises/	ESGNews
177	“The challenges the world is facing call for a massive step up in the international community’s support,” the bank said in the document. 	https://esgnews.com/world-bank-seeks-more-funds-to-address-climate-change-other-crises/	ESGNews
178	“For the WBG to continue to play a central role in development and climate finance, it will need a concerted effort by both shareholders and management to step up WBG financing capacity.” 	https://esgnews.com/world-bank-seeks-more-funds-to-address-climate-change-other-crises/	ESGNews
179	The roadmap document cautions that a build-up of lending for climate change, health care, food security and other needs may require a capital increase to boost the capacity of the World Bank’s middle-income lending arm, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). 	https://esgnews.com/world-bank-seeks-more-funds-to-address-climate-change-other-crises/	ESGNews
180	IBRD’s $13 billion capital increase in 2018 “was designed to be prepared for one mid-sized crisis a decade, and not multiple, overlapping crises” including the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the effects of accelerating climate change, the document said. 	https://esgnews.com/world-bank-seeks-more-funds-to-address-climate-change-other-crises/	ESGNews
181	IBRD’s crisis buffers will likely be depleted by mid-2023, it said. 	https://esgnews.com/world-bank-seeks-more-funds-to-address-climate-change-other-crises/	ESGNews
182	Another option, according to the roadmap, is for World Bank shareholder countries to step up periodic contributions to the lender’s fund for the world’s poorest countries, the International Development Association (IDA), which have declined in recent years despite increasing needs. 	https://esgnews.com/world-bank-seeks-more-funds-to-address-climate-change-other-crises/	ESGNews
183	The roadmap also offers the option of creating a new concessional lending trust fund for middle-income countries that would focus on global public goods and be similar in structure to IDA, with regular funding replenishments that would be separate from the bank’s capital structure. 	https://esgnews.com/world-bank-seeks-more-funds-to-address-climate-change-other-crises/	ESGNews
184	“Such a fund may attract donor bilateral resources separate from shareholder budget lines supporting the WBG, and potentially include donors beyond shareholders,” such as private foundations, the bank said. 	https://esgnews.com/world-bank-seeks-more-funds-to-address-climate-change-other-crises/	ESGNews
185	The bank said that the evolution of its mission to increase climate lending while maintaining good development outcomes will require additional staff and budget resources, which have declined 3% in real terms over the past 15 years.Source: Reuters	https://esgnews.com/world-bank-seeks-more-funds-to-address-climate-change-other-crises/	ESGNews
